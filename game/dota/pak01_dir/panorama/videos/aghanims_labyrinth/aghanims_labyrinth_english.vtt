00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:09.470
<v ->Any layman with a feeble grip</v>

2
00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:11.263
can carve wood or hammer steel.

3
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.300
Even the tender hands of a child

4
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.783
can grasp a set of instructions.

5
00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:28.270
But to create something takes rare hands.

6
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.410
Shrewder hands. Handsome, brilliant hands.

7
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.237
The hands that forged the first scepter of power.

8
00:00:53.538 --> 00:00:56.940
My hands have slipped through dimensions,

9
00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.683
touching things that warped the mind

10
00:00:59.683 --> 00:01:02.053
to test the mettle of the strongest willed.

11
00:01:13.651 --> 00:01:16.000
From the far reaches of the astral plane,

12
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.550
beyond countless dimensions,

13
00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.312
MONSTERS! BEASTS! Beasts without legs!

14
00:01:22.312 --> 00:01:27.300
Beasts that are only legs! Heroes that aren't heroes at all!

15
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.948
I have brought them here to answer one simple question:

16
00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.840
Can your hands wield the true Aghanim's Scepter?
