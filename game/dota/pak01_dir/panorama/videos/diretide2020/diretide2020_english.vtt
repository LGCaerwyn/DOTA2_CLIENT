00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:05.363
There was a thing in the woods.

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:12.400
But once a year, it left the woods to feast

00:00:14.071 --> 00:00:15.483
on us.

00:00:24.803 --> 00:00:29.795
Then one year, out of the woods came... nothing.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.433
Another year passed, and another.

00:00:52.671 --> 00:00:55.300
Over time, we forgot our fear

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.193
and turned our backs on the dark.

00:01:21.937 --> 00:01:26.937
Slivers of the Mad Moon hang forgotten in our sky...

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.250
slowly aligning.

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.250
It is time again, the tide rises and brings with it

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.170
... something dire.
