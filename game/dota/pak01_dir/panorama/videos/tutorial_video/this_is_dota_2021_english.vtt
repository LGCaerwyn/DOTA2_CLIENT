00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.750
<v ->Enjoyed by millions for over a decade,</v>

2
00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:10.043
Dota is a game of strategy, momentum and action.

3
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.050
Two teams of five players called Radiant and Dire

4
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.410
face off in a vast battlefield.

5
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.530
The first team to destroy the opposing team's Ancient

6
00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:24.593
will win the match.

7
00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:30.430
However, there are many steps on the road to the Ancient.

8
00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.810
Before the battle begins each player chooses a unique hero

9
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.380
from a pool of over 100 potential fighters,

10
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.259
each with their own abilities, strengths and weaknesses.

11
00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.180
Teams then enter the battlefield

12
00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.970
and compete to slay opposing players,

13
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.080
or computer-controlled forces called creeps,

14
00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.050
in order to earn experience

15
00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.253
to augment their heroes' abilities and gold

16
00:00:59.253 --> 00:01:03.270
to purchase items that increase their heroes' power.

17
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.670
As players become more powerful,

18
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.870
they will lead their forces to eliminate

19
00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.730
the opposing team's defensive towers

20
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.749
in each of the three lanes that cross the battlefield.

21
00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.970
If a team wishes to gain an additional advantage,

22
00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.460
they may also choose to face the monster Roshan,

23
00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.270
who guards the Aegis of the Immortal.

24
00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.010
A unique item which allows a slain hero

25
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.504
to immediately return to life.

26
00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.250
After the towers are eliminated,

27
00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.580
players may begin assaulting the opposing team's base.

28
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.150
Within each base are several sets of barracks,

29
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.480
which if destroyed, will strengthen

30
00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.463
the forces of the attacking team.

31
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.870
Beyond the barracks lies the Ancient itself,

32
00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:55.290
protected by a final group of defensive towers.

33
00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.858
The match ends if either teams' Ancient is destroyed.

34
00:02:07.031 --> 00:02:08.631
This is Dota.
