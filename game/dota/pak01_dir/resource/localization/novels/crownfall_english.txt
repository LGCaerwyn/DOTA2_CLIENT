	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_main-01-02_6_Screeauk"		"To end Imperia's reign."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_main-01-04_2_Screeauk"		"Imperia KNOWS of the Kazurai now. She turns over every stone. Her spies are everywhere."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_main-01-04_3_Shen"		"She's scared. She realizes what the Flightless could do if they fought as one."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_main-01-04_4_Shen"		"If I know my sister, she won't want a fair fight."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_main-01-04_5_Dragonus"		"She'll use the Queensguard to ferret them out before they're ready."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_main-01-04_6_Dragonus"		"And EXECUTE them for treason in the public square."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_main-01-05_1_Shen"		"So if we want the Kazurai's help to retake my throne..."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_main-01-05_2_Dragonus"		"We'll need to find them before she does. And CONVINCE them to fight by our side."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_main-01-05_3_Screeauk"		"Exactly. That's why we must hurry."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_main-01-05_4_Shen"		"So where are we going?"

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-01_2_Dragonus"		"It is our wings. They envy us. Completely understandable."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-01_3_Screeauk"		"They hate you because your sister tortures and disappears them."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-01_4_Screeauk"		"Once you regain power, princess, you must work toâ€”"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-01_5_Screeauk"		"Get your HAND out of my coinpurse!"

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-02_3_Meepo1"		"You mentioned cuttin' off a hand?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-02_4_Dragonus"		"That is where we START."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-03_5_Meepo1"		"The important part is if ONE of us dies, we're ALL kaput. Think ya can cut us a break?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-03_6_Dragonus"		"Mph..."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-03_7_Meepo1"		"Or better yet, HELP us?"

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-04_1_Shen"		"What crime landed your brother in The Cage?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-04_2_Meepo1"		"Funny story. My OTHER twin brother made some bad bets with a Queensguard and didn't pay up."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-04_3_Meepo2"		"And since we all look the same to these birdbrains, our OTHER other twin brother was the one they tossed in jail."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-04_4_Meepo3"		"Hey Meepo! You catchin' these birdbrains up?"

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-05_3_Meepo3"		"I solved it! We could just TELEPORT him out of jail, like."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-05_4_Meepo1"		"Nah, we can only do that up close. The Cage they're keepin' him in is way up in the clouds."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-05_6_Meepo3"		"Some nice wings you got there, by the way, lady. Bet you could fly CRAZY high with those things."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-05_7_Meepo1"		"Like up to a sky prison I bet."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-06_4_Shen"		"...there are hundreds of Queensguard patrolling The Cage. We would be caught as well."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-06_5_Meepo1"		"Naw, I thought of that. While YOU'RE breakin' him out, WE'LL head over to the Midgate border and create a distraction!"

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act2_Dialogue_warlock-01-05_5_PakRajul"		"First of all, I very much doubt four guys dumb enough to summon a demon without casting a return spell first even KNOW how to kill me."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act2_Dialogue_warlock-01-05_6_Axe"		"Wait. We were supposed to cast a return spell?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act2_Dialogue_warlock-01-05_7_Warlock"		"Ohhh. A RETURN spell. So if he proved too powerful for us to beat, he would automatically get sent back."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act2_Dialogue_warlock-01-05_14_PakRajul"		"Face it, guys. Either way you're screwed. So why don't you read the words backwards and let me get out of here before you kill me and curse the land even worse."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act2_Dialogue_warlock-01-05_15_PakRajul"		"I'm kidding. You would NEVER kill me. Let me get out of here before I kill all of you."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act2_Dialogue_warlock-01-07_13_Axe"		"Quiet contemplation was what got us in all the trouble in the first place. We were powerless against demons like this."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act2_Dialogue_sandfishing-goodjob-alt04_0_Beatrix"		"Thanks for helpin' out with the pest control. Wish you'd dropped by ages ago."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act2_Dialogue_sandfishing-okayjob_0_Beatrix"		"Not bad. I think you'll do even better next time."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act2_Dialogue_sandfishing-okayjob-alt01_0_Beatrix"		"Room for improvement. But not too shabby."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act2_Dialogue_sandfishing-badjob_0_Beatrix"		"Well, maybe sand-fishin' ain't your for-tay."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act2_Dialogue_sandfishing-badjob-alt01_0_Beatrix"		"Well, no luck. We can try again tomorrow."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act2_Dialogue_sandfishing-badjob-alt02_0_Beatrix"		"It's harder than it looks, ain't it?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act2_Dialogue_sandfishing-badjob-alt03_0_Beatrix"		"We'll get 'em next time. They ain't goin' nowhere."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act2_Dialogue_sandfishing-badjob-alt04_0_Beatrix"		"You just got skunked, fancy-wings."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act2_Dialogue_flappy-skywrath-win_0_Batrider"		"I don't believe it! You BEAT me!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act2_Dialogue_flappy-skywrath-win-alt01_0_Batrider"		"Nice flyin', pal. You won fair and square."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act2_Dialogue_flappy-skywrath-win-alt02_0_Batrider"		"That was some fine flappin'."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act2_Dialogue_flappy-skywrath-lose_0_Batrider"		"You lose, bird guy."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act2_Dialogue_flappy-skywrath-lose-alt01_0_Batrider"		"Sorry, bird guy. That's second place."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act2_Dialogue_flappy-skywrath-lose-alt02_0_Batrider"		"Nice flappin'. But not nice enough."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act2_Dialogue_clickable-hunt-reward1_0_Beatrix"		"[THIS LINE ISN'T USED BUT EXISTS FOR NOW]"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act2_Dialogue_clickable-hunt-reward2_0_Beatrix"		"The first ingredient I'm gonna need for that cure-all cocktail is the PETALS from a CACTUS FLOWER."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act2_Dialogue_clickable-hunt-reward2_1_Beatrix"		"Fortunately you should find 'em growin' close by."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act2_Dialogue_clickable-hunt-reward2_2_Beatrix"		"But so ya know: They're REAL delicate. You're probably gonna bust a few before you pluck a good one."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act2_Dialogue_clickable-hunt-reward2-claimable_0_Beatrix"		"Hey, you found me a CACTUS FLOWER! Hope you didn't destroy my whole cactus garden gettin' it."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act2_Dialogue_clickable-hunt-reward3_0_Beatrix"		"The second ingredient I'll need is a bag fulla DEMON BLOOD."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act2_Dialogue_clickable-hunt-reward3_1_Beatrix"		"Now, the recipe says it SHOULD be the demon who stabbed him. But lemme tell ya, I've made dozens of these things, any demon blood'll do."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act2_Dialogue_clickable-hunt-reward3_2_Beatrix"		"I'll bet there's piles of dead demons from that battle you boys were fightin' up there. If it was me I'd look there first."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act2_Dialogue_clickable-hunt-reward3-claimable_0_Beatrix"		"That looks like a bag fulla DEMON BLOOD to me. Let's check. Yup. Tastes like demon."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act2_Dialogue_clickable-hunt-reward4_0_Beatrix"		"Alrighty! Halfway there! Now the third thing I'll need is a PUFFBALL MUSHROOM."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act2_Dialogue_clickable-hunt-reward4_1_Beatrix"		"Unlike the cactus, these might be a little trickier to find. They hide under the sand."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act2_Dialogue_clickable-hunt-reward4_2_Beatrix"		"Just look for a little bump. You'll find one."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act2_Dialogue_clickable-hunt-reward4-claimable_0_Beatrix"		"You found me a PUFFBALL MUSHROOM? Perfect. This cure-all's almost brewed up."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act2_Dialogue_clickable-hunt-reward5_0_Beatrix"		"Alright, the last ingredient I need is a FIREBUG THORAX."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act2_Dialogue_clickable-hunt-reward5_1_Beatrix"		"I saved the hardest for last. These buggers only live where it's real dark, and real hot."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act2_Dialogue_clickable-hunt-reward5_2_Beatrix"		"They're also timid little things. You're gonna have to sneak up on it quiet-like if you wanna catch one."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act2_Dialogue_clickable-hunt-reward5-claimable_0_Beatrix"		"You caught a FIREBUG! That was the last ingredient. Let me just rip out its thorax here. Did you want the rest?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act2_Dialogue_clickable-hunt-reward5-claimable_1_Beatrix"		"No? More for me then. Mortimer, come here, boy!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act2_Dialogue_clickable-hunt-complete_0_Beatrix"		"Here ya go, fellas! One bottle of Snapfire's Cure-All!"

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act2_Dialogue_example_7_Axe"		"Different effects are combined, instant text, shake, and bold."
