	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_main-01-01_3_Shen"		"We can't fight my sister with an entire army of Queensguard behind her, Scree'Auk."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_main-01-01_4_Screeauk"		"No, Shen. If you truly want to beat Imperia..."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_main-01-01_5_Screeauk"		"...You must convince the Flightless to fight alongside you."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_main-01-02_2_Dragonus"		"Scree'Auk, we can't beat Imperia with cooks and gardeners. We need WARRIORS to win."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_main-01-02_3_Screeauk"		"The Flightless might look helpless, Dragonus. But their hatred of Imperia rivals even yours."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_main-01-02_6_Screeauk"		"To end Imperia's reign."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_main-01-02_7_Shen"		"And... would they accept me on the throne as her successor?"

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_main-01-02_9_Shen"		"..."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_main-01-02_10_Screeauk"		"They mistrust all topsiders. And with good reason."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_main-01-02_11_Screeauk"		"We'll need to convince the Kazurai you're worthy of the throne."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_main-01-03_3_Shen"		"I'll do my best. Lead the way."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_main-01-03_4_Screeauk"		"I'd love to. Sadly, thanks to your sister, he's in hiding. Nobody knows WHERE he is."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_main-01-04_2_Screeauk"		"Imperia KNOWS of the Kazurai now. She turns over every stone. Her spies are everywhere."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_main-01-04_3_Shen"		"She's scared. She realizes what the Flightless could do if they fought as one."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_main-01-04_4_Shen"		"If I know my sister, she won't want a fair fight."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_main-01-04_5_Dragonus"		"She'll use the Queensguard to ferret them out before they're ready."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_main-01-04_6_Dragonus"		"And EXECUTE them for treason in the public square."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_main-01-05_0__title"		"A Race to the Kazurai"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_main-01-05_1_Shen"		"So if we want the Kazurai's help to retake my throne..."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_main-01-05_2_Dragonus"		"We'll need to find them before she does. And CONVINCE them to fight by our side."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_main-01-05_3_Screeauk"		"Exactly. That's why we must hurry."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_main-01-05_4_Shen"		"So where are we going?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_main-01-05_5_Screeauk"		"We're almost there. Just to the right up ahead. I know someone who might help us."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-01_2_Dragonus"		"It is our wings. They envy us. Completely understandable."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-01_3_Screeauk"		"They hate you because your sister tortures and disappears them."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-01_4_Screeauk"		"Once you regain power, princess, you must work toâ€”"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-01_5_Screeauk"		"Get your HAND out of my coinpurse!"

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-02_3_Meepo1"		"You mentioned cuttin' off a hand?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-02_4_Dragonus"		"That is where we START."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-02_6_Meepo1"		"This is in that 'loaf of bread to feed yer starvin' family' category of stealin'."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-02_7_Shen"		"This had better be good."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-03_0__title"		"Lousy with Twins"

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-03_5_Meepo1"		"The important part is if ONE of us dies, we're ALL kaput. Think ya can cut us a break?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-03_6_Dragonus"		"Mph..."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-03_7_Meepo1"		"Or better yet, HELP us?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-04_0__title"		"All for One..."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-04_1_Shen"		"What crime landed your brother in The Cage?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-04_2_Meepo1"		"Funny story. My OTHER twin brother made some bad bets with a Queensguard and didn't pay up."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-04_3_Meepo2"		"And since we all look the same to these birdbrains, our OTHER other twin brother was the one they tossed in jail."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-04_4_Meepo3"		"Hey Meepo! You catchin' these birdbrains up?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-04_5_Meepo1"		"Hey Meepo! You bet. See, the thing is, they're gonna EXECUTE him."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-05_2_Meepo1"		"Hey Meepo. What's up."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-05_3_Meepo3"		"I solved it! We could just TELEPORT him out of jail, like."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-05_4_Meepo1"		"Nah, we can only do that up close. The Cage they're keepin' him in is way up in the clouds."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-05_5_Meepo3"		"Ahh, you're right."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-05_6_Meepo3"		"Some nice wings you got there, by the way, lady. Bet you could fly CRAZY high with those things."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-05_7_Meepo1"		"Like up to a sky prison I bet."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-05_9_Shen"		"Yes, it certainly sounds like someone with wings would be essential to your jailbreak."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-06_3_Shen"		"Even if I WAS willing to go along with this..."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-06_4_Shen"		"...there are hundreds of Queensguard patrolling The Cage. We would be caught as well."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-06_5_Meepo1"		"Naw, I thought of that. While YOU'RE breakin' him out, WE'LL head over to the Midgate border and create a distraction!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-06_6_Meepo3"		"Yeah! We got bird disguises and everything! Real nice ones!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-06_7_Dragonus"		"You'll create a distraction sufficient to call every Queensguard in Skywrath?"
