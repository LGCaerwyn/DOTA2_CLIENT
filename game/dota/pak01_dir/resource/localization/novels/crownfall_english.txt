	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_main-01-02_6_Screeauk"		"To end Imperia's reign."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_main-01-04_2_Screeauk"		"Imperia KNOWS of the Kazurai now. She turns over every stone. Her spies are everywhere."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_main-01-04_3_Shen"		"She's scared. She realizes what the Flightless could do if they fought as one."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_main-01-04_4_Shen"		"If I know my sister, she won't want a fair fight."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_main-01-04_5_Dragonus"		"She'll use the Queensguard to ferret them out before they're ready."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_main-01-04_6_Dragonus"		"And EXECUTE them for treason in the public square."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_main-01-05_1_Shen"		"So if we want the Kazurai's help to retake my throne..."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_main-01-05_2_Dragonus"		"We'll need to find them before she does. And CONVINCE them to fight by our side."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_main-01-05_3_Screeauk"		"Exactly. That's why we must hurry."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_main-01-05_4_Shen"		"So where are we going?"

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-01_2_Dragonus"		"It is our wings. They envy us. Completely understandable."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-01_3_Screeauk"		"They hate you because your sister tortures and disappears them."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-01_4_Screeauk"		"Once you regain power, princess, you must work toâ€”"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-01_5_Screeauk"		"Get your HAND out of my coinpurse!"

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-02_3_Meepo1"		"You mentioned cuttin' off a hand?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-02_4_Dragonus"		"That is where we START."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-03_5_Meepo1"		"The important part is if ONE of us dies, we're ALL kaput. Think ya can cut us a break?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-03_6_Dragonus"		"Mph..."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-03_7_Meepo1"		"Or better yet, HELP us?"

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-04_1_Shen"		"What crime landed your brother in The Cage?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-04_2_Meepo1"		"Funny story. My OTHER twin brother made some bad bets with a Queensguard and didn't pay up."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-04_3_Meepo2"		"And since we all look the same to these birdbrains, our OTHER other twin brother was the one they tossed in jail."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-04_4_Meepo3"		"Hey Meepo! You catchin' these birdbrains up?"

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-05_3_Meepo3"		"I solved it! We could just TELEPORT him out of jail, like."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-05_4_Meepo1"		"Nah, we can only do that up close. The Cage they're keepin' him in is way up in the clouds."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-05_6_Meepo3"		"Some nice wings you got there, by the way, lady. Bet you could fly CRAZY high with those things."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-05_7_Meepo1"		"Like up to a sky prison I bet."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-06_4_Shen"		"...there are hundreds of Queensguard patrolling The Cage. We would be caught as well."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-06_5_Meepo1"		"Naw, I thought of that. While YOU'RE breakin' him out, WE'LL head over to the Midgate border and create a distraction!"

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act2_Dialogue_warlock-01-05_5_PakRajul"		"First of all, I very much doubt four guys dumb enough to summon a demon without casting a return spell first even KNOW how to kill me."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act2_Dialogue_warlock-01-05_6_Axe"		"Wait. We were supposed to cast a return spell?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act2_Dialogue_warlock-01-05_7_Warlock"		"Ohhh. A RETURN spell. So if he proved too powerful for us to beat, he would automatically get sent back."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act2_Dialogue_warlock-01-05_14_PakRajul"		"Face it, guys. Either way you're screwed. So why don't you read the words backwards and let me get out of here before you kill me and curse the land even worse."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act2_Dialogue_warlock-01-05_15_PakRajul"		"I'm kidding. You would NEVER kill me. Let me get out of here before I kill all of you."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act2_Dialogue_warlock-01-07_13_Axe"		"Quiet contemplation was what got us in all the trouble in the first place. We were powerless against demons like this."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act2_Dialogue_clickable-hunt-reward2_2_Beatrix"		"But so ya know: They're REAL delicate. You're probably gonna bust a few before you pluck a good one."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act2_Dialogue_clickable-hunt-reward3_0_Beatrix"		"The second ingredient I'll need is a bag fulla DEMON BLOOD."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act2_Dialogue_clickable-hunt-reward3_1_Beatrix"		"Now, the recipe says it SHOULD be the demon who stabbed him. But lemme tell ya, I've made dozens of these things, any demon blood'll do."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act2_Dialogue_clickable-hunt-reward3_2_Beatrix"		"I'll bet there's piles of dead demons from that battle you boys were fightin' up there. If it was me I'd look there first."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act2_Dialogue_clickable-hunt-reward4_0_Beatrix"		"Alrighty! Halfway there! Now the third thing I'll need is a PUFFBALL MUSHROOM."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act2_Dialogue_clickable-hunt-reward4_1_Beatrix"		"Unlike the cactus, these might be a little trickier to find. They hide under the sand."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act2_Dialogue_clickable-hunt-reward5_2_Beatrix"		"They're also timid little things. You're gonna have to sneak up on it quiet-like if you wanna catch one."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_main-01-04_Shen_2"		"Perhaps we could slaughter a bluehorn and crawl into its carcass?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_main-01-04_Maiden_3"		"Sure!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_main-01-04_Maiden_4"		"You'll certainly die quicker that way. They're FILLED with blood. You'd be frozen solid in five minutes."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_main-01-05_Maiden_1"		"...I say let's get the heck out of this frozen death trap and take the mountain paths instead."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_main-01-05_Bakeet_0"		"M-m-mountain p-paths? Is it w-w-warmer in the mountains?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_main-01-05_Maiden_2"		"Ha ha ha! No, it's MUCH colder."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_main-01-05_Maiden_3"		"But at least there's wood to burn and you can see where you're going!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_main-01-05_Maiden_4"		"But first, let's cull a few bluehorns and make you guys up some winter clothes."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_main-01-05_Maiden_5"		"You can climb in the guts while I stitch up the hides, if you want."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_main-01-06_Maiden_5"		"A DRAGON?! Huh. I didn't know that, either. I think maybe I'll tag along, if that's alright with you two."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_main-02-01_Bakeet_0"		"Are dragons common in Icewrack?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_main-02-01_Maiden_2"		"Not if I have anything to say about it. Awful, fang-faced nasty things. We had one move in a few years back. "

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_main-02-03_Kestrel_2"		"The Flightless needed a hero and Kraw thought that was us. Everyone in Midgate thought that."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_main-02-03_Kestrel_3"		"They trusted me to train an army to fight Imperia... and all I did was get a bunch of kids killed."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_main-02-03_Kestrel_4"		"I don't want anyone else dying because of me. <br/>If I'm gonna help people I'd rather do it on my own."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_main-02-04_Kestrel_1"		"I disbanded them after the ambush. Made them go back to their families in Skywrath."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_main-02-04_Kestrel_2"		"Some of them wouldn't. They'd spent their whole lives fighting. They'd rather die than stop. They went south with Kraw."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_main-02-05_Shen_2"		"If you want to hide up here, FINE. But don't kid yourself that it's over. Your actions are still getting people killed, whether you choose to be there or not."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_main-02-05_Shen_3"		"Imperia has always treated the Flightless poorly. But mostly she ignored them. <br/> They were beneath her contempt."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_main-02-05_Shen_4"		"When you and Kraw formed the Kazurai, you made her see the Flightless as something else... a THREAT."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_main-02-06_Maiden_2"		"And instead of killing it, you just made it angry. Which sounds like it might be a pattern with you dumdums, by the way, but that's none of my business."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_main-02-06_Maiden_3"		"What IS my business is the lives of these villagers. You want to go off and help YOUR people? Super."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_main-02-07_Kestrel_1"		"Used to be every night until me and Gralla showed up. We put up some resistance and it stopped coming."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_main-02-07_Kestrel_2"		"Maybe we scared it off for good, but I doubt it. Probably just taking a break 'til it gets hungry enough to take another run at us."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_main-02-07_Maiden_1"		"Well shoot, that's easy then! There's FIVE of us and only one of it! We just wait 'til it comes back, then team up on it and STAB STAB STAB STAB STAB!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_main-02-07_Shen_0"		"It could be months before it returns. We don't have that kind of time. There must be some way to track it to its home and deal with this now."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_main-02-07_Maiden_3"		"If anyone knows dragons, it's OTHER dragons. And I DO know where ANOTHER dragon is. Let's go bother HER about it!"

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_lina-01-01_Maiden_2"		"There's only ONE woman in the realms who'd be that spiteful and destructive just to get my attention."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_lina-01-01_Shen_0"		"It sounds like you two aren't on the best of terms."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_lina-01-01_Maiden_4"		"What? No, I love her to bits, she's my sister. She's just stupid and I hate her sometimes."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_lina-01-01_Shen_1"		"Not that it's any of my business, but she's come all this way just to speak with you. Perhaps you could use this opportunity to reconcile?"

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_lina-01-01_Shen_2"		"Good point. So we're hiking to the top of that mountain to help you kick your sister's ass."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_lina-01-01_Maiden_6"		"No. We're going to hike up that mountain and listen to what she has to say."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_lina-01-01_Maiden_7"		"And then she's going to say something insulting and then blame me for our parents never talking to us, and THEN we're going to kick her ass."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_lina-01-02_Maiden_1"		"I thought you were Lina! You don't have fire powers! How'd you set an entire mountaintop on fire?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_lina-01-02_Geraldus_1"		"Whew, it wasn't easy. It is REALLY hard to make a fire around here."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_lina-01-02_Bakeet_0"		"We know."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_lina-01-02_Geraldus_2"		"But then I found a grove of everwood over there, and THAT lit up like nobody's business."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_lina-01-02_Lina_0"		"Interesting. Because the Collectors have been following you since you LEFT White Spire six days ago."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_lina-01-03_Maiden_4"		"What about that time you said I froze all the crops and we had to leave town? In the middle of the night, come to think of it."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_lina-01-03_Geraldus_3"		"That wasn't a lie. You DID freeze the crops. I had to hold you up next to them all night. Insurance scam. Again, it sounds worse than it should without context."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_lich-01-03_Maiden_3"		"Or wait. Maybe the weights werenâ€™t magic, they were just heavy. Either way, they carried him up into the Barriers and dropped him in this bottomless black pool."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_main-04-05_Shen_2"		"Look. The Shards of Frostburn are crumbling to dust."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_main-04-05_Maiden_4"		"Oops. I hope Wyvern didn't want those back."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_main-04-05_Kestrel_0"		"I hate to say it, princess... but that was some impressive flying."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_main-04-05_Bakeet_0"		"Impressive, it was AMAZING! Princess, you DID it! You killed a DRAGON!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_main-04-05_Shen_3"		"We did it, little bird. We've come a long way from Skywrath."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_main-04-05_Shen_4"		"But I think it's time we headed back. The final battle for Skywrath draws near."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_main-04-05_Shen_5"		"I just hope we are not too late."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_act-threebeard-intro_Threebeard_0"		"Hey, it's you guys again! What do you think of my new cave?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_act-threebeard-intro_Shen_0"		"Uh. Isn't itâ€”"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_act-threebeard-intro_Threebeard_1"		"Because I LOVE it! It's better than all my other caves! I made sure it had a fireplace and a chimney..."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_act-threebeard-intro_Threebeard_2"		"...and nice floors so my feet wouldn't get cold, and windows so I can see out on nice days..."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_act-threebeard-intro_Threebeard_3"		"...and I made sure the cave walls were made out of wood instead freezing damp rock!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_act-threebeard-intro_Shen_1"		"How did you afford a hou... a cave like this?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_act-threebeard-intro_Threebeard_4"		"You remember how I kept getting bitten by bats in my last cave? I sued the city!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_act-threebeard-complete_Threebeard_0"		"Hey guys! How's the quest going?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_act-threebeard-complete_Shen_0"		"Pretty good. How's the cave working out?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_act-threebeard-complete_Threebeard_1"		"Better than I could have possibly imagined. I might grow a fourth beard!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_strange-vendor-intro_StrangeVendor_0"		"YOU TRADE OR ME CRUSH!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_strange-vendor-intro_Maiden_0"		"I speak a little abominable. I think he's saying we should trade with him orâ€”"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_strange-vendor-intro_Shen_0"		"Thanks, I got it."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_strange-vendor-outro_StrangeVendor_0"		"IS DEAL, NOW LEAVE!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_strange-vendor-outro_Maiden_0"		"WE LEAVE, GOOD DEAL! Shen, tell him it was a good deal so he doesn't crush us."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_strange-vendor-outro_Shen_0"		"...Good... good deal! Me like deal!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_strange-vendor-outro_StrangeVendor_1"		"Hmph."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_strange-vendor-outro_Maiden_1"		"Well that was just insulting, Shen. Geez Louise, next time just let me do the talking."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_token-trader-intro_TokenTrader_0"		"Please forgive my appearance, I must look terrible. I died this morning."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_token-trader-intro_TokenTrader_1"		"I was hiking up in the mountains and drowned in a bottomless pool."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_token-trader-intro_TokenTrader_2"		"Well, there was a sign there that said it wasn't, but I think it was."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_token-trader-intro_TokenTrader_3"		"Honestly, for being dead I feel pretty good. How do I look? Mostly alive? I look dead, don't I?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_token-trader-complete_TokenTrader_0"		"Come back anytime!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_token-trader-complete-alt1_TokenTrader_0"		"A pleasure doing business."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_token-trader-complete-alt2_TokenTrader_0"		"Be honest: on a scale of alive to dead where would you put me?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_fighting-game-story-intro-long_Shen_0"		"Oh good, you're back. I'm glad you're here this early."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_fighting-game-story-intro-long_Tusk_0"		"This late, you mean. What time is it?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_fighting-game-story-intro-long_Shen_1"		"It is time for us to head out into the Frozen Waste. Have you sobered up enough to reconsider being our guide?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_fighting-game-story-intro-long_Tusk_1"		"No to all of that. Who the hell's screaming?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_fighting-game-story-intro-long_Shen_2"		"It appears to be a giant angry porcupine at the other end of the bar."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_fighting-game-story-intro-long_Tusk_2"		"Is it the start of the month already? Dumb bastard's ship must have just come in."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_fighting-game-story-intro-long_Tusk_3"		"If that's who I think it is, you two should grab a seat, cuz you're in for a show. Is he running at me?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_fighting-game-story-intro-long_Bakeet_0"		"Not yet. Oh wait, yes, he is. Gosh, he's swearing a lot."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_fighting-game-story-intro-long_Tusk_4"		"Ha! That's who I think it is, alright."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_fighting-game-story-intro-short_Tusk_0"		"Welcome to the bar where we all fight!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_fighting-game-story-intro-short_Tusk_1"		"First rule of the bar where we all fight is... I'm too drunk to remember. Who wants to fight?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_fighting-game-story-fight-loss_Bakeet_0"		"The porcupine guy seemed to hit you a lot more than you hit him."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_fighting-game-story-fight-loss_Tusk_0"		"He got lucky a few dozen times."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_fighting-game-story-fight-loss-alt1_Bakeet_0"		"Great fight! Not for you, obviously."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_fighting-game-story-fight-loss-alt1_Tusk_0"		"I didn't hear no bell."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_fighting-game-story-fight-loss-alt1_Bakeet_1"		"I think you were unconscious."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_fighting-game-story-fight-win_Tusk_0"		"THERE. Now... what were we talking about again?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_fighting-game-story-fight-win_Shen_0"		"We were asking if you'd reconsidered being our guide."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_fighting-game-story-fight-win_Tusk_1"		"Ohhh, right."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_fighting-game-story-fight-win_Tusk_2"		"Nope."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_match3-game-intro_WinterWyvern_0"		"Dragon Chess. A grand drama played on a stage of sixty-four squares."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_match3-game-intro_WinterWyvern_1"		"A game of intellect and strategy. A game where you need to match three gems of the same color. It takes most dragons centuries to master."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_match3-game-intro_WinterWyvern_2"		"Shall we?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_match3-game-intro-short_WinterWyvern_0"		"Back for more? I can't blame you. Truly this game is a labyrinth of possibilities."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_match3-game-loss_WinterWyvern_0"		"I win, of course."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_match3-game-win_WinterWyvern_0"		"Hmph. Beginner's luck."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_choose-hero-intro_ChooseHero_0"		"ME CATCH! YOU PAY OR I KILL!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_choose-hero-intro_Maiden_0"		"I think he's saying he caught three travellers, and he's going to kill them if we don't pay him."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_choose-hero-intro_Maiden_1"		"HOW MUCH YOU WANT?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_choose-hero-intro_ChooseHero_1"		"HUNDRED GOLD!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_choose-hero-intro_Maiden_2"		"ME ONLY HAVE TWENTY!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_choose-hero-intro_ChooseHero_2"		"PICK ONE ME NOT KILL!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_choose-hero-intro_Maiden_3"		"Okay, good news, I haggled him down."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_choose-hero-complete_ChooseHero_0"		"ME SET THAT ONE FREE! ME KILL OTHER TWO!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_choose-hero-complete_Maiden_0"		"No, don't set them loose in the Frozen Waste! They'll just..."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_choose-hero-complete_Maiden_1"		"Yep. That was fast."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_choose-hero-complete_ChooseHero_1"		"NO REFUNDS!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_choose-hero-complete-afterwards_ChooseHero_0"		"NO REFUNDS!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward1_Thrael_0"		"Welcome to the Library of Gorod. You will find every priceless manuscript, ancient text, scientific work, and historical document here, safely stored in these fireproof walls."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward1_Thrael_1"		"Of course, fireproofing doesn't come cheap. Not to mention the cost of all the priceless manuscripts."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward1_Thrael_2"		"So... *cough* ...donations are of course welcome."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward2_Thrael_0"		"Excellent! You're back to make another donation?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward2_Maiden_0"		"Yep. Why do you guys need donations, though? You used to have stacks of priceless treasures piled up around here."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward2_Thrael_1"		"Yes. It turns out all those priceless treasures did, in fact, have a very specific price."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward2_Thrael_2"		"My master was... exceedingly generous with their pricing when she made me sell them all at the Frostreach flea market."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward2_Maiden_1"		"Wow. All that to buy books?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward2_Thrael_3"		"BOOK. She purchased a single book with them."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward2_Thrael_4"		"Did I mention donations are welcome?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward3_Thrael_0"		"You're back to make ANOTHER donation? It's so refreshing to see lovers of literature like yourself out here."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward3_Thrael_1"		"We're such a remote library. Usually the only customers I get are constipated yetis looking for books on home brewing laxatives."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward3_Shen_0"		"Why..."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward3_Thrael_2"		"All yetis eat is raw meat."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward3_Shen_1"		"What..."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward3_Thrael_3"		"Rhubarb and senna, I'm told."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward4_Thrael_0"		"Back again? With ANOTHER donation? We might have to name a wing of the library after you!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward4_Bakeet_0"		"Bakeet Bazura. B-A-Z-U-R-A."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward4_Thrael_1"		"The Bakeet Bazura Yeti Constipation wing!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward4_Bakeet_1"		"Wow!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward5_Thrael_0"		"ANOTHER donation? Lovely! Just lovely! And what is your full name, madam?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward5_Maiden_0"		"Rylai Moon."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward5_Thrael_1"		"The Rylai Moon wing of the Gorod Library!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward5_Maiden_1"		"Gosh!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward6_Thrael_0"		"Back with another donation? Excellent. You're such book lovers!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward6_Thrael_1"		"I believe you are the last of your party not to have a wing named after them, madam."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward6_Shen_0"		"Oh, I don't need a library wing named after me."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward6_Thrael_2"		"Madam, your generosity is boundless! The libary of Gorod insists. Your full name?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward6_Shen_1"		"It's Shendelzare Ophanim Semyaza Rhamiel Qaddisin Tatrasiel."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward6_Thrael_3"		"..."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward6_Shen_2"		"I really don't need a wing named after me."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward6_Thrael_4"		"...Excellent. Good."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward7_Thrael_0"		"You're back AGAIN? This is most pleasing. At this rate we'll be able to purchase new shelving for the works of the warrior-poet Xin."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward7_Thrael_1"		"His books are made of flame-wreathed magma rock. Very tedious to store."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward8_Thrael_0"		"Astonishing. You have given so much, and still you return to donate more."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward8_Thrael_1"		"Thanks to your generosity, the library might finally be able to procure one of the rarest books in the realms..."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward8_Thrael_2"		"The journal of the alchemist Jovat Kazran."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward8_Thrael_3"		"I am told there is a spell contained within it that can turn you into a GOD."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward8_Maiden_0"		"Wow. Are you going to read it?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward8_Thrael_4"		"I mean... I might skim it here and there."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward9_Thrael_0"		"I can accept no more donations from you after this. Your generosity is boundless."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward9_Thrael_1"		"Thanks to your benevolence, we will be able to purchase the rarest books in all the realms."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward9_Thrael_2"		"The Archronicus. The Book of the Infernal Maw. Perhaps even the fabled lost Book of Heavens!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward9_Bakeet_0"		"Wow. I am DEFINITELY going to come back here once I learn how to read."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward9_Thrael_3"		"Our doors will always be open to you, Bakeet Bazura."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-complete-once_Thrael_0"		"The library thanks you for your benevolence."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-complete-once-alt1_Thrael_0"		"The library is in your debt."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-complete-once-alt2_Thrael_0"		"The library thanks you for your beneficence."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-complete_Thrael_0"		"We can take no more donations! We have run out of wings to name after you!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-complete_Thrael_1"		"Your generosity is boundless, travellers. Thank you."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_example-do-not-localize__title_0"		"Into the Waste"
