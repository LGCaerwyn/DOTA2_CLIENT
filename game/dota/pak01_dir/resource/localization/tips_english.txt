		"dota_tip_hero_phantom_lancer_2"	"Phantom Lancer relies on his many illusions to deal most of his damage. Investing in items that will allow killing those illusions quickly, such as Shiva's Guard or Mjollnir, could prove very beneficial."
		"dota_tip_hero_phantom_lancer_3"	"Phantom Lancer can use Doppelganger to dispel some debuffs as well disjoint projectiles."
		"dota_tip_hero_phantom_lancer_4"	"Illusions of Phantom Lancer that are created by enemy abilities, such as Shadow Demon's Disruption or Terrorblade's Reflection will still have a chance to fracture into more illusions."

		"dota_tip_hero_puck_4"				"If the opponents rely heavily on magic immunity, Puck may choose to purchase an Aghanim's Scepter to make sure that Dream Coil stays a powerful disable."
		"dota_tip_hero_puck_5"				"Puck has many area of effect abilities, and it is crucial to stay spread out when playing on the opposite team."

		"dota_tip_hero_pudge_8"				"The Dismember audio effect can be heard by anyone, even if Pudge himself is hidden, and can be used to guess what the Pudge is currently doing."
