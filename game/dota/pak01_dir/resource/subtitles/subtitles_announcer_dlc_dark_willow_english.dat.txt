"
	"3204206141"	"Your graphics card falls below our official minimum specs,
which have not been changed in the transition to Dota 2 Reborn.
When running under the Source 1 engine, that did not prevent
the game from working because the engine was not designed around
the full capabilities of the minimum spec for graphic cards.
However, Dota 2 Reborn relies on graphics features such as vertex textures and shader model 3.0
and so adherence to the minimum spec is a stronger requirement
than it was in Source 1 Dota 2. Unfortunately this means that Dota 2 Reborn
will not be able to run on some graphics cards from 2006 or before.

	"2578212988"	"Goodbye radiant, hello dire!"
	"3971264026"	"Radiant victory!"
	"1926249401"	"Radiant victory!"
	"4123354026"	"The Dire Ancient is destroyed! "
	"2193773372"	"See Jex? Radiant weren't too inept after all!"
	"480691871"	"Radiant triumphs over dire!"
	"6512850"	"Generally the other way around is better."
	"2573873512"	"Looks like the end of a beautiful friendship."
	"4000121342"	"Hope you're getting something out of this..."
	"1879675997"	"Why does that tower even try?"
	"118400203"	"You're right, Jex. They really should do something about that."
	"2651321713"	"Where are the reinforcements?"
	"3909141991"	"You know, Jex could take care of that...if the price is right."
	"270705412"	"When are they gonna learn, Jex?"
	"2301358782"	"Was that a plan? Not a good one."
	"4264346152"	"Yes, Jex. I know you could have done better."
	"1615353739"	"I guess it was inevitable."
	"391079709"	"Towers crumble, empires fall, and a sucker's born every minute."
	"2386966183"	"Highway robbery, Jex. Plain and simple."
	"4181788209"	"Can't fight the war for them, Jex... Not the way this works."
	"1778260896"	"Are you playing the long game?"
	"519646006"	"Jex has some...thoughts on your strategy."
	"2118034131"	"Ugh. What do I even say to that?"
	"154767941"	"No, Jex. I won't tell them that."
	"2419115007"	"I know, Jex... You were right."
	"845645186"	"I love when that happens."
	"2876167224"	"It was only a matter of time."
	"3697927342"	"Ahh, just like my father's observatory."
	"1108177165"	"Ooh, right where it hurts."
	"889864603"	"Are we sure the enemy understands the rules?"
	"1702148220"	"Oh, hey. Uhh, Good job?"
	"3674480823"	"Don't get too excited. I mean, it's just a tower..."
	"1270562086"	"Haha, pay up Jex!"
	"1018957232"	"They didn't need you after all, Jex."
	"1551598677"	"Hoo hoo! The enemy isn't going to like that. Hehe."
	"729593027"	"Burn it all down!"
	"3614836379"	"Oh, I'd love to see the look on their faces!"
	"3312637423"	"Next time, remember: loot first, smash second."
	"1528184908"	"Oooh. Hopes crushed, I?m sure."
	"3163384989"	"Oh, high level tactics..."
	"629423399"	"I like where this is going..."
	"2327048014"	"Stop those sneaky bastards in their tracks."
	"3437729810"	"I wouldn't let my father hear me say it, but all the best wards come from Revtel."
	"3152062596"	"Ooh, a rapier, Jex. This is going to be exciting."
	"585759038"	"Tryin' ta refresh my interest in this fight?"
	"1441712552"	"Oh boy."
	"1796020258"	"So what are you going to do now?"
	"4060367256"	"Ooo, that kind of failure stings, doesn't it?"
	"2231597326"	"You could just sit there and wallow in failure... Or get out there and raise hell!"
	"795050192"	"God this is dull. Least I have you, Jex... Oi, wake up you!"
	"3060453738"	"There's absolutely nothing happening here. Is this normal?"
	"3245203964"	"Who do I have to kill around here to get someone to kill someone around here?!"
	"1594455135"	"What I wouldn't give for a smoke gank about now. Or a way out of here."
	"1659100429"	"I rate this whole affair a big thumbs down. You're all lucky I don't have any pit-fighting slaves. Or an empire..."
	"2970031475"	"You fall asleep again Jex, I'll rattle your cage."
	"3321898469"	"I know it's boring, Jex. But the penalty for leavin's quite harsh..."
	"4267994195"	"Time to go!"
	"1735212521"	"Break time's over, Jex."
	"275385727"	"Didn't know you could call a time out from war..."
	"2383321308"	"Let's hope that doesn't happen again."
	"2476555469"	"I understand the sentiment, but surely there's a better way."
	"177499511"	"Look at this quitter, Jex."
	"2106809825"	"Look, Jex. You scared 'em away."
	"3824666690"	"At least steal something precious before you go..."
	"2498820308"	"Well, that's one kind of exit strategy..."
	"3515168375"	"Player disconnected."
	"1217161165"	"Time out! Someone's missing."
	"1066096475"	"Did they disconnect or get disconnected?"
	"2716844792"	"Those with honor might pause here..."
	"3605590638"	"Steal a last hit or two..."
	"1340187604"	"Someone's gone. Quick, Jex! Go find 'em."
	"1544018608"	"See, they came back!"
	"3306064650"	"Never a doubt in my mind."
	"2603051430"	"All mid."

	"2967572521"	"Almost no limits. I like it."
	"703119763"	"What are you feeling today, friend?"
	"1592783109"	"There's hardly anyone here."
	"3230360742"	"A couple winners in that group...maybe."
	"3079427120"	"But...what if the captain's an imbecile?"
	"780469642"	"I don't like having choices made for me, Jex..."
	"1501705500"	"Eh, it's a bit lame, Jex. But baby steps you know?"
	"3376228493"	"This doesn't seem like Dota at all, Jex."
	"3191478299"	"Ugh. These people disgust me, Jex."
	"3741159934"	"Oh, I could have some fun with this."
	"2851774824"	"I don't think they really understand the rules, Jex."
	"821293266"	"A straight up fight? Why would you want that?"
	"1207222340"	"It's the game within the game."
	"3650115047"	"Let's see. How many they got, Jex? Only three?!"
	"2929157489"	"Hope they're versatile..."
	"3117555680"	"Welcome to Dota."
	"2203433619"	"Welcome to Dota."
	"551243354"	"So you've come to play Dota."
	"1474068172"	"Such a twisted game to play. Just how we like it."
	"3384339311"	"Welcome to Dota. Do you realize what you've done?"
	"3200244729"	"The rules are simple. The strategies...not so much."
	"511869482"	"Welcome to Dota. Home to cutthroats, thieves...and whatever it is you are."
	"2789139791"	"So, this is Dota. Or whatever."
	"666274371"	"Welcome to Dota. Home to cutthroats, thieves...and whatever it is you are."
	"1353824981"	"So, this is Dota. Whatever."
	"4250523527"	"Oh, you shouldn't have..."
	"1682998845"	"Well, I know who my money's on."
	"324515499"	"Oh god, I thought we came here to have fun..."
	"2368938760"	"And that's the sound of my interest drying up."
	"4197716894"	"So long as he dies a lot..."
	"1664959012"	"Ugh, influencers... We're just watching to see you fail!"
	"339374770"	"Hey, big spender!"
	"2223337251"	"This one looks like an easy mark..."
	"4085407669"	"What?! What kind of operation is this?"
	"2470827600"	"This is going to be hilarious. For me. Not for any them."
	"3829589702"	"So that's how it's going to be..."
	"2102114172"	"Well, that's certainly A choice..."
	"172787690"	"What'dya think, Jex? They got what it takes?"
	"2485654089"	"I've a pretty good idea how this'll all turn out. But you'll have to wait and see."
