"
	"3204206141"	"Your graphics card falls below our official minimum specs,
which have not been changed in the transition to Dota 2 Reborn.
When running under the Source 1 engine, that did not prevent
the game from working because the engine was not designed around
the full capabilities of the minimum spec for graphic cards.
However, Dota 2 Reborn relies on graphics features such as vertex textures and shader model 3.0
and so adherence to the minimum spec is a stronger requirement
than it was in Source 1 Dota 2. Unfortunately this means that Dota 2 Reborn
will not be able to run on some graphics cards from 2006 or before.

	"2789524148"	"You have spawned Megacreeps!"
	"1062048526"	"Excellent, you now have Megacreeps! I do hope they're not contagious."
	"1212851096"	"Things are looking up, you have megacreeps. Which sounds odd when you say it out loud, doesn't it?"
	"3593352763"	"Reinforcements have arrived! Megacreeps are yours, thank goodness!"
	"1673292715"	"We now have megacreeps."
	"2278193535"	"We have been reinforced with Megacreeps!"
	"516106437"	"Megacreeps are on our side! Which is not something you hear often, I must say."
	"1774458963"	"We have the megacreeps - things will be quite dangerous for our enemies now!"
	"4154494448"	"Megacreeps - that's just fun to say... Oh, and we have them on our side now!"
	"1546689206"	"The enemy now has megacreeps."
	"2057131668"	"Megacreeps on the horizon - I'm afraid the enemy has them. Watch out!"

	"3139275560"	"The Radiant now have megacreeps."
	"2601958636"	"Whether we like it or not, Radiant now counts Megacreeps among its forces."
	"35646806"	"Will Radiant's new Megacreeps push them over the top?"
	"916413129"	"Roshan has fallen to the Dire!"
	"2829258916"	"Fantastic! The Dire slayed Roshan!"
	"833241374"	"Roshan is but a bitter memory thanks to the Dire."
	"1185771912"	"Roshan's death comes at the hands of the Dire!"
	"3637109803"	"I seem to be at a loss: the Dire have actually slain Roshan."
	"3084693362"	"Roshan has fallen to the Radiant!"
	"3887465478"	"I can confirm: the Radiant brought Roshan down."
	"2126468540"	"Roshan is gone and the credit absolutely must go to the Radiant."
	"163079466"	"Down goes Roshan at the hands of the Radiant. Good riddance!"
	"2547839113"	"This just in: Radiant slays Roshan. Details uneccessary."
	"687277964"	"Welcome to Dota!"
	"2986235446"	"Good to see you again, old friend. Let's play some Dota!"
	"3338233504"	"Ah, you're back, superb, let's get started then!"
	"1486746371"	"A fine thing running into you here - let's play some Dota!"
	"798671765"	"Lets show them what you and I can accomplish together! Dota!"
	"3063124527"	"Time to defend the Ancients my friend, let's do this!"
	"3247743673"	"Defend the cores! I mean Ancients, yes Ancients."
	"1361821480"	"Hello, excellent to be partnered up once more - let's show them what we can do."
	"640454590"	"Excellent seeing you again, let's dive into the competition, shall we?"
	"1189807707"	"Why hello there. I'm thinking about playing some Dota, what about you?"
	"837564109"	"Welcome. The water's lovely -- why don't we dive right on in?"
	"2833606519"	"Greetings my friend, so good to see you. Shall we play a game or three?"
	"3813173964"	"All Pick."
	"2928741189"	"All Mid!"
	"3750869082"	"Least Played!"
	"1771676446"	"All Pick - This will require you to make a choice. But that's life isn't it, one choice after another?"
	"3726245396"	"All Random."
	"3812813271"	"All Random - Leave your fate to chance. As if it was ever any other way!"
	"393355425"	"Captain's Draft."
	"1199327386"	"Captains Mode."
	"225422645"	"Random Draft."
	"4064091981"	"Random Draft - be a good sport and pick a card, any card"
	"2833544542"	"Single Draft."
	"2234789526"	"Single Draft - let's see what you can do with just three choices."
	"1345231643"	"Death Match."
	"1210684553"	"Death Match - hmm, that sounds rather unpleasant."
	"3104847955"	"Easy Mode."
	"1928051353"	"Easy mode - That actually sounds quite relaxing."
	"383886277"	"Reverse Captain's Mode."
	"3555373420"	"Interesting Choice, Hmmm."
	"2621477952"	"I admit the anticipation is almost unbearable. I wonder what the first move will be?"
	"88720890"	"Clearly each team is sizing the other up before striking."
	"2603438169"	"Hah, I'm sensing a particularly clever strategy at work here."
	"35914211"	"Perhaps we can gain additional insight by watching very closely."
	"1965240693"	"I can guess at what they're up to. But it is rather interesting, isn't it?"
	"3852217572"	"Oh Look! Wait, I'm sorry, that was just a shadow."
	"1800782893"	"I can see the strain on each side. No easy victory here!"
	"4113650062"	"It can't be much longer now... any raspberries in those bushes?"
	"51221992"	"Dire victory!"
	"3276735919"	"The Dire have claimed victory - what a performance!"
	"1514558485"	"The Dire prevails, proving their mettle once again!"
	"759260291"	"And, yes,... it's the Dire with the win!"
	"3005608224"	"I must admit, I didn't see it coming, but the Dire pull it off!"
	"3290612150"	"I must congratulate the Dire - an absolutely smashing success for them!"
	"2428204122"	"Radiant victory!"
	"1626536790"	"There cannot be a question: the win goes to the Radiant!"
	"4194020076"	"A Radiant victory all around!"
	"2398919290"	"The Radiant has the victory and I must say they've earned it."
	"278400985"	"And so the Radiant claim victory and the day. As they should!"
	"1738489679"	"Thus the Radiant seize the win!"
	"2720515902"	"Congratulations! You've proven your mettle and beaten back the enemy!"
	"992908932"	"They'll think twice before challenging us again!"
	"1277797906"	"It's just too bad there's no one left to complain about that one. Oh, no wait, it isn't too bad all!"
	"3528274865"	"Well done - Now you have time for a rest - a very very short rest."
	"2773091111"	"No surprise to me in the slightest - but you've done it!"
	"1011045021"	"Now THAT is what this world should look like - free of the enemy!"
	"1262772747"	"I believe we are, finally, secure. Well done!"
	"3690692506"	"If I didn't know better I'd say you'd been preparing your entire life for this."
	"2902216460"	"A hard fought battle and a sweet, sweet victory!"
	"3426469609"	"I'll be savoring that victory for quite some time, I should think."
	"856563972"	"Well, that was unfortunate - let's try something else."
	"2852614334"	"We can't always get it right, can we? Let's give it another go."
	"3707781160"	"I'm sure we can think of another way to proceed. At least, I think I'm sure..."
	"1130681739"	"Right. Another go, then?"
	"878961949"	"I am absolutely certain we can take them. Let's have another go, shall we?"
	"2909451431"	"No surprise here, you're constantly improving."
	"3664610353"	"Experience is the key. And now you have it. Let's go again!"
	"1255315872"	"Steady improvement wins the game. We'll take them yet."
	"1037412662"	"All things are possible with time and patience. And we have both."
	"1561469139"	"Mastery comes in small steps. Onward, friend!"
	"1899512370"	"Failure is the forge of victory. Back at them!"
	"3895530376"	"A simple job, simply done. Perfect."
	"2671125278"	"Well done!"
	"22197949"	"Rather like clockwork for you, isn't it? Excellent."
	"1985316395"	"I can see improvement in your every move."
	"3177747906"	"Not quite it, but ever so close. Carry on."
	"610387064"	"I'm afraid that's not it, but I have complete faith in you."
	"3227128601"	"Well, Hello there! And welcome back!"
	"1498628771"	"I've been wondering where your travels had taken you."
	"777286197"	"Welcome back, it's been far too long, my friend."
	"2955995030"	"Excellent. You've returned - let's do this, shall we?"
	"3342325504"	"Very happy to see you my friend, shall we engage in some mayham?"
	"1581156026"	"Don't give in now -- you've almost got it."
	"691648044"	"Not it, but ever so close."
	"3112610749"	"I must insist we try that once again."
	"3464600363"	"I do believe you're getting the right idea."
	"2923827918"	"All indications are that you're getting the hang of it now."
	"3644924504"	"Fantastic! You've nearly got it!"
	"1078490082"	"That almost worked!"
	"927941492"	"You can do this, of that I am quite sure. "
	"2838222551"	"No worries, I'm behind you all the way"
	"3727484481"	"There is no I in quit: oh, wait there is -- but you still shouldn't do it."
	"1193654267"	"I have no doubt that we can do this!"
	"901297164"	"Someone has disconnected from the game - it's a shame really, they had such potential."
	"2897339830"	"Someone disconnected."
	"1867164220"	"A player has returned, we welcome them with open arms, unless of course they're on the other team..."
	"4131650438"	"A player returns."
	"4162253364"	"I'd buy that item too, if I could."
	"1629463438"	"Well purchased."
	"370709272"	"Nicely spent."
	"2289829563"	"A fine pick up."
	"4286264877"	"Now you'll be able to take on even more."
	"1866560575"	"Let's get back to the action!"
	"4131923333"	"Right, now back to it!"
	"2169443603"	"We now return our regularly scheduled carnage!"
	"522944688"	"No more time to rest, stay sharp!"
	"180761030"	"Really, already?"
	"2479841404"	"Well, lets do this again soon. Very soon."
	"3838333162"	"I think we should do this again sometime."
	"2058143049"	"Looking forward to next time."
