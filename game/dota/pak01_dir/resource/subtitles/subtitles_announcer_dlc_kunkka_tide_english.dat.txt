"
	"3204206141"	"Your graphics card falls below our official minimum specs,
which have not been changed in the transition to Dota 2 Reborn.
When running under the Source 1 engine, that did not prevent
the game from working because the engine was not designed around
the full capabilities of the minimum spec for graphic cards.
However, Dota 2 Reborn relies on graphics features such as vertex textures and shader model 3.0
and so adherence to the minimum spec is a stronger requirement
than it was in Source 1 Dota 2. Unfortunately this means that Dota 2 Reborn
will not be able to run on some graphics cards from 2006 or before.

	"3835688015"	"You'll get your sea legs yet!"
	"2107024885"	"Caught in the tide rip!"
	"177313123"	"Time to forge ahead!"
	"3824300118"	"Hopes sink just like Kunkka's ships."
	"3602668405"	"Searching for hidden treasure?"
	"1337264847"	"Those are worth more than gold."
	"951204441"	"Clear skies ahead!"
	"2799087610"	"Kunkka's not the only one with a spyglass."
	"3520175980"	"Now there's a powder-packed magazine!"
	"1222168278"	"A refreshing possibility!"
	"1071644224"	"There's a gollywobbler!"
	"3553401194"	"Back from the maelstrom!"
	"1254475984"	"The watch bell is ringing!"
	"1036187718"	"Time to get your head above water. Grow some gills."
	"3847038733"	"This game has certainly run aground."
	"2084861623"	"Maelrawn take me, this is boring!"
	"188958241"	"Looks like we've run against the ash breeze. It's dead calm."
	"2502415234"	"This is like swimming in slack water."
	"3793806100"	"You layabouts! Swab the back-head grating!"
	"2066330286"	"Maybe I'll take up beachcombing. Take me with you."
	"204374584"	"What's the word from the crow's nest? It's dead calm."
	"1185279259"	"Weigh anchor, this game is on."
	"3752639649"	"I was practicing my backstroke."
	"2829814839"	"And we're under way."
	"919542164"	"I had time to find a snack."
	"1504942864"	"Jumping ship, you traitorous dog?"
	"3233467050"	"Sea slime has more backbone than a quitter."
	"3082680892"	"A quitter, ay? Throw him in the brig!"
	"702115743"	"The sea hates a coward."
	"1591631625"	"A captain should go down with the ship. My thoughts exactly!"
	"1643622811"	"Man overboard! Heave to!"
	"4177453089"	"Someone's connection just drowned."
	"2415513783"	"Hahaha. I wreck any undersea cable I get my hands on."
	"295519508"	"If they're wearing a corkshirt, they'll pop up soon enough."
	"1721398658"	"They always float to the top eventually. Just wait a minute."
	"4287833144"	"Now is the time for diplomacy. That's rich coming from you, Kunkka."
	"4262991050"	"Finally came up for air!"
	"1729185136"	"Welcome back, landlubber. Get any salt in your lungs?"

	"1848655835"	"Probably some good ones in there."
	"423038797"	"More like Admirals Mode!"
	"2151571191"	"Let the wind take us where she may!"
	"4147736161"	"Why's it always captains? I hate captains!"
	"1736864752"	"Where the heroes choose you."
	"1883687555"	"Now I'M the admiral!"
	"121764373"	"This compass must be broken."
	"2655562671"	"How about... Tidehunter versus Kunkka."
	"3914308409"	"For the novice captain."
	"1999310490"	"One of three we shall see!"

	"3186421206"	"What's this, Gyro? Gone on the account?"
	"596146293"	"Best set a reef in the main!"
	"1418676451"	"Kunkka!"
	"3448117593"	"Go team green!"

	"708719710"	"The rogue wave himself."
	"1564017864"	"A controversial pick!"
