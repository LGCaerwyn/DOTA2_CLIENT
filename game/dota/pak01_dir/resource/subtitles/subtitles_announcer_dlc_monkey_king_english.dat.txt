"
	"3204206141"	"Your graphics card falls below our official minimum specs,
which have not been changed in the transition to Dota 2 Reborn.
When running under the Source 1 engine, that did not prevent
the game from working because the engine was not designed around
the full capabilities of the minimum spec for graphic cards.
However, Dota 2 Reborn relies on graphics features such as vertex textures and shader model 3.0
and so adherence to the minimum spec is a stronger requirement
than it was in Source 1 Dota 2. Unfortunately this means that Dota 2 Reborn
will not be able to run on some graphics cards from 2006 or before.

	"347876125"	"Radiant's Ancient is under attack!"
	"4266111150"	"Your Ancient is under attack!"
	"1733222676"	"Your Ancient is under attack!"
	"273273218"	"If your Ancient falls, consider me unimpressed."
	"2385331233"	"I'm something of an expert in dodging rules, but even I know: Defend the Ancient!"
	"2687836069"	"That's the one thing that can't happen!"
	"960253471"	"Now comes the good part!"
	"1752532727"	"The Dire now have megacreeps."
	"2337077881"	"The Radiant now have megacreeps."
	"1791430657"	"The enemy now have megacreeps."
	"3055453217"	"You now have megacreeps."
	"532311224"	"On the bright side, fighting creeps just got more intense."
	"2259893506"	"But you better smash that Ancient before they do."
	"4055109012"	"Not the most epic fight I've seen, but it's about to be in the books."
	"1875941431"	"Let's see Radiant deal with that."
	"416786593"	"It shouldn't be long now."
	"2178873627"	"Dire might be done for."
	"4141468045"	"That might be the final chapter in this tale."
	"3120009079"	"Dire just fortified their structures."
	"553574093"	"Dire's structures are fortified."
	"1475997275"	"Dire have fortified their structures. Cowards."
	"2988608477"	"Radiant just fortified their structures."
	"724294247"	"Radiant's structures are fortified."
	"1546447601"	"Radiant have fortified their structures. Weaklings."
	"1713908590"	"Radiant are scanning for enemies."
	"4116801260"	"Dire are scanning for enemies."
	"2768167535"	"Radiant's courier has been killed."
	"1039643605"	"Radiant's courier just got turned into a fine mist."
	"2626585022"	"Dire's courier has been killed."
	"92786692"	"Dire's courier isn't finishing that run."
	"516937393"	"Delightful."
	"430052008"	"Perhaps they'll graduate to killing heroes next."
	"2277934859"	"Not a proper kill, but not without merit."
	"4039227293"	"What was that courier doing there, anyway?"
	"1856315966"	"Noble creatures, couriers. Entrusted with treasures that would bankrupt most kingdoms."
	"3994811123"	"Roshan has fallen to the Dire."
	"1997712201"	"Roshan goes about this immortality thing all wrong."
	"1416159"	"Roshan's dead. Not exactly a tragedy."
	"920791721"	"Roshan has fallen to the Radiant."
	"2951445267"	"An Aegis grants something of a second-rate immortality, if you ask me."
	"3639364485"	"Old Roshan'll be back. Not sure how long, though. Always so difficult to say."
	"3541386042"	"Dire victory!"
	"1243353728"	"Dire win! I knew it'd unfold like this."
	"1025188374"	"Dire smash the Ancient! This one's over."
	"3771610316"	"Radiant victory!"
	"2043110774"	"Radiant claim the victory! I had a feeling."
	"247485920"	"The Dire Ancient falls! Radiant have done it!"
	"1017408160"	"Only a fool would tolerate this aggression!"
	"2779593498"	"What kind of hero are you, anyway?"
	"3534359436"	"Do something, worm!"
	"1288609327"	"Do I really need to explain this?"
	"1003073209"	"I'd never allow such insolence!"
	"2730557187"	"Are you even listening to me?"
	"3586641813"	"This reminds me of my encounter with -- Hrm. Another time, perhaps. When you've earned it."
	"1165545988"	"Are you even paying attention?"
	"2002219979"	"This isn't some game!"
	"3999146609"	"Those don't come back, you know."
	"2572751591"	"Did you even try to deny it?"
	"121472836"	"It's ok. Towers make you weak. You don't need them."
	"1882896338"	"Trees grow back. Towers don't."
	"3912492648"	"Remember how I was saying they were under attack?"
	"2654263038"	"Oh, this reminds me of my encounter with -- oh. Another time, perhaps. When you've earned it."
	"244042607"	"If you're trying to make it a challenge, it's working."
	"2039282681"	"That's certainly never happened to me."
	"424374812"	"It's not over, but you're not helping yourself."
	"4148499248"	"Can't say I didn't see it coming."
	"1427264845"	"Following in my legendary footsteps."
	"3424322807"	"What'll you smash next?"
	"3139187809"	"There's no denying your minor accomplishment. Well done."
	"628662722"	"Go on, gloat a little."
	"1384091988"	"Well played!"
	"3413557486"	"You'll be drinking and singing victory songs in no time."
	"3161583736"	"Smashing!"
	"1539956095"	"That's one way to do it."
	"990794906"	"It took you long enough."
	"1275683852"	"Ready for the ancient yet, or you just going to loiter about until something happens?"
	"3573560758"	"Push the advantage -- crush your enemy!"
	"2718369056"	"Hmm. Things just got a bit easier, eh? Meh."
	"1264885781"	"Can we end this now? I've admirers waiting."
	"2019807161"	"You need wards to see hidden demons?"
	"3781860867"	"Don't waste those -- they're expensive."
	"2131626912"	"Wards? You can support me anytime."
	"3859241498"	"Look at this charming devil, buying all these wards."
	"2523770517"	"It's a pretty good rapier. I don't know that I'd go so far as to call it divine."
	"134822710"	"That's mine! Or else a forgery."
	"13352539"	"So how does that whole dying thing work, anyway?"
	"2579689441"	"Back to the fight, you lazy cur!"
	"4005945207"	"Less dying, more killing!"
	"1107741409"	"Top is missing!"
	"3675233115"	"Middle is missing!"
	"2886249421"	"Bottom is missing!"
	"2506652639"	"So which story about me do you like best?"
	"207694437"	"So when is this going to get interesting?"
	"2070289139"	"I was trapped in a rock for 500 years. I know boring when I see it."
	"3842150224"	"How about all 10 heroes go Radiant, I go Dire? No, better make it 20 heroes."
	"2449850310"	"This is the clash to decide the fate of the world? I've seen better."
	"185396860"	"Someone put my name back in that book and kill me!"
	"2081152746"	"You do realize there's an Ancient to smash, yes?"
	"2510473770"	"Back to the fight!"
	"212573072"	"Finally! What were we waiting for?"
	"2074913542"	"I tip my staff to the player who paused, but let's get on with it!"
	"3855105701"	"Hopefully that was the last of that."
	"697747394"	"Wait, you're quitting?"
	"2963248760"	"What kind of hero quits before it's over?"
	"1509700429"	"I've heard of quitters. Just never seen any before."
	"788202459"	"You can't undo this."
	"16718121"	"A player disconnected."
	"2583054483"	"That player dropped. Pause maybe?"
	"4008802309"	"Someone's techno-wizardry just fizzled."
	"1888873894"	"It's not fun if we're not all here. Stop the fight!"
	"127065392"	"Someone DC'd. Timeout!"
	"2660994186"	"For once I'm in favor of a pause."
	"2639230228"	"See? No one walks out on a story I'm telling."
	"71705774"	"I knew they wouldn't abandon the fight."
	"349107551"	"All mid."
	"3924598419"	"All pick."
	"889701301"	"All random."
	"860467142"	"Captain's draft."
	"338151821"	"Captain's mode."
	"3947090391"	"Death match."
	"3781308473"	"Easy mode."
	"1349958715"	"Least played."
	"1527211229"	"Random draft."
	"2388423129"	"Reverse captain's mode."
	"2975574724"	"Single draft."
	"2351340123"	"Who shall fight for your cause?"
	"355453921"	"Throw some fur into the wind."
	"1646852983"	"Captain's mode or not, I'm the boss."
	"4232867540"	"I make my own fate. What of you?"
	"2336972354"	"Too scared for actual Captain's Mode?"
	"306319352"	"So when you die, you come back as. . .someone else?"
	"1699037038"	"A lot of good choices here. Only one legendary monkey warrior, though."
	"4126810879"	"Defeat them with their own choices."
	"2197623401"	"A classic throwdown."
	"3795491724"	"Only one opponent? Maybe do it left-handed."
	"2503846682"	"A draft? Can't we just get to the fighting?"
	"204798624"	"It almost doesn't matter who you pick, so let's go."
	"3524573593"	"Welcome to Dota."
	"1260251171"	"And now, the Monkey King's Special Presentation of: The Battle of the Ancients!"
	"1008392373"	"Well, well. You've returned. Good show."
	"2726186262"	"Good. You're here. Now we can get on with it."
	"3581508992"	"The Monkey King welcomes you, noble warrior."
	"2501247325"	"You insist on torturing me. "
	"203378919"	"Just for that, I hope you lose."
	"400001943"	"If I couldn't be myself, I might choose Azwraith as well."
	"2396969517"	"You know you've made it when they start impersonating you."
	"4191808187"	"Oh, the fabulous Monkey Ki-- Wait! That's not me!"
	"2582785358"	"Never trust a gaoler."
	"3909088622"	"There's a slippery fellow. After my own heart."
	"2620236552"	"Nothing I hate worse than an overeager Warden."
	"2275315278"	"These two got cell mates? Unfair!"
	"3732110419"	"That's not the Monkey King. Are you trying to lose?"
	"1199189481"	"No Monkey King? Was that a misclick?"
	"813505919"	"Do you even know what you're doing? The right pick was Monkey King!"
	"2920909020"	"You should have picked the Monkey King. But you've got spirit to defy me. "
	"1221743140"	"They'll be telling this story for 10,000 years!"
	"3520791454"	"Get ready for the greatest ride of your life!"
