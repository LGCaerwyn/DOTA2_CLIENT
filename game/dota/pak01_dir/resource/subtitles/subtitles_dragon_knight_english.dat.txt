	"3204206141"	"Your graphics card falls below our official minimum specs,
which have not been changed in the transition to Dota 2 Reborn.
When running under the Source 1 engine, that did not prevent
the game from working because the engine was not designed around
the full capabilities of the minimum spec for graphic cards.
However, Dota 2 Reborn relies on graphics features such as vertex textures and shader model 3.0
and so adherence to the minimum spec is a stronger requirement
than it was in Source 1 Dota 2. Unfortunately this means that Dota 2 Reborn
will not be able to run on some graphics cards from 2006 or before.

	"1099854086"	"The dragon Slyrak sleeps within this armor, and the knight within the Dragon waits. Beware you do not wake them both."
	"914964880"	"The wisdom of the Eldwurms, fused with the valor of the ageless knight: this is the source of my nobility."
	"676044916"	"Just what I've been waiting for."
	"2973954510"	"Worth its weight in gold."

	"4102029971"	"Regeneration!"
	"1837716265"	"My scales shine like new."
	"3902636606"	"Illusion!"
	"1905578884"	"Thrice the knight."
	"2019543145"	"Invisibility!"

	"1489204639"	"I fight through the pain..."
	"801391881"	"Pain is temporary..."
	"3066893491"	"Takes more than that to kill an eldwyrm..."

	"1014555862"	"I found it... the aegis of immortality..."
	"178805471"	"Time to find out if what they say about Avernus is true."
	"2476804965"	"I've never trusted you Abbadon, but we have to find a way to work together."
	"3836099571"	"You ever been to the Shoehorn in the Helio Emperium?  Guy there looks just like you."
	"2059578960"	"Try not to blow me up, ok?"
	"3821797354"	"You hate mages?  When this is over let me introduce you to a guy named Invoker..."
	"1937039995"	"Nice to meet another sensible guy who hates magic."
	"74699501"	"You did the best you could, Zet - no one could contain the ancients."
	"330525598"	"You're my kind of stupid, Axe."
	"2327460388"	"Goodkind should write a buddy comedy about us..."
	"4257024690"	"So you're the nightmare of gods...thought you'd be, I dunno, scarier."
	"1675206417"	"If you're looking for some material for new nightmares, you should talk to Slyrak... he's seen some things."
	"350138247"	"Just do me a favor and watch where you throw the napalm?"
	"2379742781"	"I'll make sure Slyrak doesn't eat your bat."
	"4207988395"	"The hunt is on, Beastmaster."
	"1785713466"	"I'll help you protect the forest."
	"493413292"	"What do the Flayed Twins want, Bloodseeker?"
	"1335429323"	"If you try to betray us, I'll kill you myself"
	"949893213"	"How are things in Revtel, Gondar?"
	"2711054823"	"Nice to be on the same side for once..."
	"3599784305"	"Got any whiskey on ya?"
	"1224002770"	"I don't suppose you got any liquid courage you wanna share..."
	"1072954436"	"When the fights over lets destroy some bars."
	"2801446398"	"If I have to go to war, glad it's with a tough sonofabitch like you..."
	"3523059048"	"Spiders. Great."
	"1094877433"	"Trap them in your web, Broodmother, I'll do the rest."
	"910536815"	"We would make a killing together in the Omex Arena."
	"1451374986"	"You think you could take Wu Kong?  He brags about being a cage fighter, but I think it's all a show."
	"562366748"	"Today a pillar of creation fights alongside a fundamental."
	"3096205478"	"I'm not trying to be pedantic, but knights swear oaths, and chaos kind of stands for the exact oppositie so maybe you should come up with a better name for yourself."
	"3482019888"	"I won't mince words.  I hate you Chen.  I hate you and everything the Kinghts of the Fold represent... but today we're allies, and you can trust me."
	"1374682515"	"Don't worry Chen, if I were to betray you I'd stab you in the front, not the back."
	"652791045"	"God I'd love to hear some of your stories Clinkz..."
	"3219233983"	"Cover me when I go in."
	"3370560553"	"Nice armor."
	"1482273208"	"Ya know, I always thought you were supposed to be a robot."
	"794722606"	"Thanks for the help Rylai..."
	"432254797"	"So... hows your sister doing?"
	"1858379739"	"With your brain, and my sword, theres no army we can't beat."
	"4157460065"	"After the battle, come with me to Dragon Hold, I'm sure Father would love to talk to you."
	"2160787191"	"There's an easier way to live your life Mireska..."
	"514747220"	"Don't take this the wrong way, but I'm keeping an eye on my coin purse."
	"1772706754"	"You're not friends with Selemene are you?"
	"2275883758"	"With you on my side, I don't fear death."
	"387458943"	"You gotta teach Bram some of your tricks, Dazzle..."
	"2011147930"	"Any word on Sorla Khan and the Red Mist?"
	"4007067424"	"You bring the lighting... and I'll summon The Thunder."
	"2663123887"	"As far as archer's go, you're not half bad."
	"235083326"	"If you ask nicely, I'm sure Mirana would give you some archery lessons."
	"1559428441"	"Stun them, and Slyrak will do the rest."
	"3321605347"	"We'll isolate them and take them apart."
	"3046201452"	"You are the most posititve person in all of ccreation."
	"623789565"	"Enchantress, you are a ray of sunshine."
	"1172950040"	"Answer me, Lord of Clazureme, how am I here.  In this time.  Something's wrong."
	"3705707938"	"Tell me, Lord of Clazureme, is there a way to undo the past?"
	"1115949057"	"What in the seven hells is that thing?"
	"3683473851"	"If father could get his hands on that gyrocopter I can only imagine what he could do with it..."
	"2894752045"	"You're trouble.  I like it."
	"1010136252"	"Your parents named you Hoodwink?  Did they not like you?"
	"1261585450"	"You can count on me, Huskar."
	"3044466753"	"Together we can save your people, Huskar."
	"3262238935"	"A whisp... here?"
	"1534624109"	"Hey little guy.  Girl.  Celestial being.  I'm gonna stop talking now."
	"746566139"	"It seems Filomena left an impresion on you."
	"2988123224"	"Your right Invoker, Selemene was always the real enemy."
	"3306951886"	"You're smart Jakiro, fighting with Slyrak is better than fighting against him."
	"1544897908"	"The Thunder welcomes you, Jakiro..."
	"722630114"	"Today we're brother's in arms, Juggernaut."
	"3148703859"	"It's an honor to fight by your side Yurnero."
	"3681214870"	"Even in death you stay loyal to your crew... I respect that."
	"1113829420"	"Don't be burded by regret Kunkka, you did the best you could, and that's all anyone can do."
	"895779002"	"It's nice to see Stonehall fighting on the right side."
	"2868909337"	"You're better than Luna, Tresdin... but not by much."
	"839468195"	"Times must truly be dire for me to be working with you."
	"2729859378"	"What game are you playing at, Lich..."
	"191508712"	"Lina... I know nows not the time, but we need to talk about what happened in The Helio Imperium."
	"2455986514"	"It would seem our fates are tied together, Lina..."
	"3792279005"	"The only good thing about you is your cat."
	"1924565068"	"Mirana may trust you, but I have my eye on you."
	"95533274"	"You'll have your revenge Lycan, I swear to you."
	"1702244671"	"I know what it's like to lose a family...I'm sorry Lycan."
	"309395881"	"I got your back, Magnus."
	"2339917843"	"Good to see you again, old friend."
	"4236206213"	"Try to keep up Mars."
	"1645999398"	"Watch me, Mars... you might learn something."
	"354207152"	"Help us win this fight, and I swear to you I'll help you find your sisters."
	"4212303004"	"Meepo, you are one loveable scumbag."
	"1806547213"	"Alright which one are you?  The one that owes me money from the courier race?  Or the one that owes me money from the dice game?"
	"480938395"	"I love you Sagan.  You're pretty ok too, Mirana."
	"1314611964"	"Princess."
	"962351722"	"Saw your show once, Wu Kong... not half bad."
	"1043437171"	"Just give me a heads up before you start singing, ok?"
	"2805516233"	"You don't happen to know any good drinking songs, do you?"
	"782035737"	"I hope you saw victory in our future..."
	"402769274"	"I know you've spoken with Mirana... what did you tell her?"
	"2164823232"	"It feels good to fight with you my friend..."
	"527171939"	"Donte... we're about to get into the second best kind of trouble..."
	"1751855605"	"Your childhood was stolen from you...I know what that feels like."
	"4049756239"	"I'm glad you started thinking for yourself, Mortred."
	"2551424385"	"Alright big guy, let's get to work."
	"108474402"	"you're a nice enough guy, Pudge, but when this is over I hope to never see you again."
	"2675859864"	"Is that really practical to fight in?"
	"264338441"	"Friendly word of advice... you're laying it on a little thick."
	"1563465582"	"How's the Jasper Circle doing?"
	"3292120788"	"I'm just going to assume you're always behind me."
	"3007247938"	"Sounds like you got some family issues Rubick..."
	"2854602499"	"Don't suppose you got a room in the Tyler Estate for Invoker, do you?"
	"876696224"	"I know luna's not technically a mage, but could you do me a favor and locker her up?"
	"1128686134"	"You talk more than Invoker.  I'm  not sure how that's possible."
	"3662623628"	"Well, you talk like Invoker, but at least you don't wear a stupid scarf."
	"2907177754"	"Shouldn't you be guarding Dark Reef?"
	"1039605387"	"How do you like the surface Slardar?"
	"1257254429"	"I got my eye on you slark."
	"3031730806"	"Don't think I've forgotten about what happenend in White Spire, Slark..."
	"3283335904"	"Can I ride Mortimer? I want to ride Mortimer"
	"1522199386"	"Slyrak.  Mortimer.  All we need is Jakiro and this can be a real party."
	"3668478881"	"We still have unfinished buisness Sven"
	"1134680603"	"I know better than to expect you to save a fellow knight Sven."
	"3720695736"	"Take it from me... you really need to talk to Yurnero."
	"868953748"	"I'll never let you in, demon."
	"2742301445"	"Terrorblade.  Today we have a common enemy.  Tomorrow you're a dead man."
	"153915057"	"If you're looking to cut down trees, may I suggest Night silver woods"
	"2418401035"	"The trees aren't your enemy Timbersaw... Selemene is."
	"272089072"	"I don't care what Bristleback says, you're an alright guy."
	"2302602826"	"Looking forward to fighting with you, Tusk."
	"4183038661"	"You are an intimidating bear man, and I'm so glad you're on my side."
	"518797250"	"Don't worry, Imperia will answer for her crimes."
	"1277025445"	"You were wronged... but together we can set things right... for you, and for Skywrath."
	"3574893855"	"I respect you, Kin of Slyrak..."
	"1265637564"	"I'm glad you freed yourself from Pugna's influence..."
	"3531163910"	"Kaden says I need to be more patient... have any advice?  Ya know, I don't even know why Kaden says that, I'm plenty patient."
	"901866497"	"Just make sure the golem knows I'm on your side."
	"1426517476"	"Oh great.  I'm working with a wizard.  That never goes bad."
	"570547570"	"What do the fates have in store for me, Weaver?"
	"3137899720"	"Is it true that you can rewrite Fate?  If so, I have a favor to ask..."
	"3423583326"	"Don't tell Mirana I said this, but you're as good a shot as she is..."
	"627841387"	"Bram gives his regards."
	"3160754385"	"Bram has been reading all of your books.  Not sure he understands them all, but he's trying."
	"752506176"	"There's no redemption for the likes of you, Osterion... don't think that winning this war cleans the slate."
	"440892195"	"You have much to answer for, Osterion...this is only the beginning of your atonement."
	"1832930229"	"I'm not a relgious man, but I have to respect you; not as a god, but as a lecher."
	"4098431503"	"You're an ass zeus, but at least you're on our side."
	"2146030608"	"Marci, just call out if you need some - Shit, I'm so sorry I didn't- ugh.  Whistle.  Whistle if you need something. Now if you excuse me I'm going to go find a hole to die in."
	"1127430728"	"Ahh"
	"3661261810"	"Ahh"
	"2906479460"	"Ah"
	"861523655"	"Ah"
	"1147076177"	"Ahhh!"
	"3713511403"	"Ah"
	"2857410429"	"Huh"
	"988775148"	"Uh"
	"758070175"	"Ah"
	"3745810516"	"Arcane Power!"
	"1179507182"	"So this is what the invoker is messing with..."
	"2736623633"	"Attack!"
	"974438827"	"Show no fear!"
	"1293152573"	"I don't back down from a fight..."
	"3547817118"	"I remember my training..."
	"2758824968"	"I'll fight till the end!"
	"1031341490"	"Father prepared me for battle..."
	"1249785124"	"I've trained with the best..."
	"3670091957"	"Face me!"
	"2915440675"	"I'll win this fight!"
	"3439432134"	"You're good, but not good enough..."
	"3120996688"	"Forget it!"
	"3186872699"	"Forget it!"
	"588247274"	"We're done here."
	"1409859708"	"We can all see where this is going."
	"3396097503"	"What did you say?"
	"2318213449"	"What did you say?"
	"3177932105"	"Say you're sorry."
	"610415859"	"Get out of my way."
	"1399129189"	"Even the Eldwurms know I'm a killer."
	"3285850612"	"So much for the element of surprise."
	"3034392930"	"Enough talk."
	"3861692933"	"Have you seen the size of my sword?"
	"1494270020"	"It's you or me!"
	"3222901246"	"DIE!"
	"3072237928"	"Face me!"
	"695874763"	"Come on!"
	"1585251421"	"I'm not backing fown from a fight."
	"3346290151"	"One of us isn't walking away..."
	"2960352625"	"You think I'm afraid of you?"
	"550271200"	"It'll take more than that to kill me..."
	"3654628836"	"Rah"
	"2932999538"	"Rah"
	"937120968"	"Rah"
	"1088185438"	"Hrrff"
	"3736662525"	"Gya"
	"2847916395"	"Sha"
	"817270993"	"Ahh"
	"1202823239"	"Bah"
	"3608067542"	"Hah"
	"542350389"	"Crazy. Stupid.  Here we go."
	"3109735823"	"FOR DRAGONHOLD!"
	"3462266137"	"Anyone spare a squire?"
	"1345939642"	"Guess I'll have to fill Bram in on the good parts later..."
	"658397228"	"Whenever you're ready, Slyrak."
	"3191277974"	"Well. Bottoms up. Might not get another chance soon."
	"988308726"	"Blink dagger."
	"2749445452"	"Oh man, Wei hates these."
	"2329277027"	"I'll use this later."
	"333226969"	"Got the rune..."
	"1692111695"	"This is usually bram's job..."
	"3299929166"	"Bounty!"
	"1572453876"	"Can't win a war without money..."
	"2643465344"	"Taking the outpost!"
	"77153594"	"We have the outpost!"
	"1939764652"	"Outpost secured!"
	"3992641551"	"We have control of the outpost!"
	"2600325273"	"It's ours now."
	"66355491"	"Took the outpost!"
	"1962127797"	"Securing outpost."
	"3830230052"	"Controlling the outpost."
	"2471206066"	"Come on come on."
	"3946996342"	"You've stirred the Eldwyrm..."
	"1917531084"	"Time to end this battle..."
	"88867674"	"It'll all be over soon"
	"19732917"	"Hope this works..."
	"2552514575"	"I'm not dead yet..."
	"4012079257"	"I can still fight..."
	"3134316597"	"Crummy wizard..."
	"3182004738"	"This wasn't supposed to be the end."
	"614521784"	"At least I went down fighting..."
	"1403513646"	"How did I lose?"
	"3452141197"	"Godsdamn it, Slyrak..."
	"3133427227"	"This can't be the end."
	"600645537"	"They're better than I thought..."
	"1422536503"	"I got too cocky..."
	"3296015014"	"Hope Bram didn't see that..."
	"3010593328"	"I don't think Mirana would be too impressed..."
	"3551890389"	"Invoker is probably laughing his ass off somewhere..."
	"2763176771"	"This is not my day..."
	"1035725561"	"I'm gonna kill that sonofabitch..."
	"1253890671"	"Not even dragon's blood'll heal that..."
	"3570945996"	"Just a...quick rest..."
	"2749333338"	"I didn't see that coming..."
	"987115232"	"It had to be somebody..."
	"1305550454"	"That complicates things..."
	"3714974695"	"It's not over till an ancient falls..."
	"3748566272"	"I don't think so."
	"1181205690"	"You get nothing."
	"828437548"	"I won't give you the satisfaction."
	"2936299919"	"You're not getting that."
	"3624096025"	"Nuh-uh..."
	"1091174563"	"Sorry friend..."
	"906833973"	"Not today."
	"2796694948"	"I won't let you win!"
	"3518307634"	"You think you won?"
	"3971534300"	"You think you won?"
	"2977076439"	"He wanted to go with me."
	"3329598529"	"Carry on with...whatever."
	"1602024955"	"Denied!"
	"114910061"	"Denied!"
	"679200109"	"Simple."
	"3055505614"	"Give up."
	"3239600216"	"It's all about timing."
	"1477521890"	"Let's not go there."
	"789971316"	"Did you catch that?"
	"3215531237"	"Lesson fees."
	"3866324663"	"I don't think so."
	"2138717965"	"You get nothing."
	"142413723"	"I won't give you the satisfaction."
	"2518260280"	"You're not getting that."
	"3776883374"	"Nuh-uh..."
	"2014837524"	"Sorry friend..."
	"252758914"	"Not today."
	"2335603281"	"Double Damage!"
	"306129899"	"Time to hit 'em hard..."
	"3211925373"	"You won't find eldwurms easy prey."
	"3385444160"	"That would make Kaden proud."
	"1354798842"	"Hope Mirana saw that..."
	"3420912730"	"Ha"
	"2784689549"	"Ha"
	"3539848475"	"Hm"
	"1274322081"	"Hu"
	"1022602295"	"Hm"
	"2727819668"	"Hm"
	"3582986498"	"Hm hm"
	"1285118136"	"Hm"
	"1000237102"	"Hm"
	"2871096767"	"Hm"
	"2721955859"	"Haste!"
	"993300905"	"Gotta strike fast..."
	"3050451184"	"Illusion!"
	"752574794"	"This feels more like Fymryn's thing..."
	"3867629983"	"Immortality!"
	"2140014629"	"I don't fear death..."
	"784547502"	"Get the dragonfire whiskey ready, this things in the bag."
	"621836967"	"Invisibility!"
	"3155766045"	"They can't fight what they can't see..."
	"1058272073"	"Talk about a heel turn."
	"2786763507"	"Remind me to think of something good to say when I use this."
	"3508376165"	"What's an Aether Lens?"
	"1333331910"	"I always run out of mana."
	"947795792"	"Why not? I've got life to spare."
	"2708956906"	"Straight forward. I like it."
	"3597686396"	"They're a misunderstood people."
	"1187990509"	"What's the matter? Afraid of a little concussion?"
	"835222395"	"I don't normally get to have stuff like this."
	"1359999646"	"Do you even have to ask?"
	"638108168"	"Note to self: no hugs."
	"3204551602"	"Why's it gotta make you feel so woozy?"
	"3355878180"	"Yeah, like that's not unsettling..."
	"1449277063"	"This one just seems kind of cruel. But the color scheme's great."
	"560268817"	"Let's try the... Boots of Travel."
	"3094108075"	"Is this just deadfall?"
	"3479922493"	"Who doesn't like butterflies?"
	"1607760556"	"Nice pajamas."
	"684935738"	"I'd say that's a bargain."
	"2049089885"	"What can I say? I'm a sword guy."
	"220565963"	"Ever wonder how I stow the sword through the cloak?"
	"2485960817"	"I thought these were free."
	"3811307751"	"Do I look like an easy mark?"
	"2102355268"	"What do you call that one?"
	"172512722"	"Why hold back?"
	"2470511720"	"Oh you love to see it."
	"3829806334"	"Sometimes aiming below the belt is all you got."
	"1962486127"	"Perfect. I know just who to stab."
	"66984441"	"Any info on the previous owner?"
	"1664716828"	"There's something really satisfying about this one."
	"339648650"	"Let's not get overconfident."
	"2369253680"	"I don't know. I just wanted to hold it."
	"4197499302"	"Kind of insidious if you think about it."
	"1683248133"	"Is it magic dust or just regular dust? I don't know how invisibility works."
	"324232339"	"Not sure where I'm going with this..."
	"2321167657"	"Stand back. I gotta try this."
	"4250731967"	"Wish Bram were here to fill this."
	"1843533870"	"Oh wait. Is this the wrong one?"
	"451225784"	"I never said I knew what I was doing."
	"746063579"	"All I'm saying is the polite way to say it is unconventional."
	"1535063629"	"I almost forgot these existed."
	"3262539767"	"I'm just trying things."
	"3044104033"	"Maybe I could arm-wrestle Marci now... No. These aren't enough."
	"722846402"	"Oh, you take gold for these now? That's nice."
	"1544745556"	"You know why ghosts are scarier than monsters? You can't punch a ghost."
	"3306922990"	"How do they even make this stuff? Why do they even make this stuff?"
	"2988217208"	"Ok, this is cute."
	"581144297"	"I'm not sure this is a good thing."
	"1436860031"	"Not the color I was after, but it'll do."
	"895694746"	"I'll be unkillable."
	"1113851660"	"Sometimes you just have to say: time out."
	"3681375926"	"It goes against everything that I stand for, but sure, sign me up."
	"2892654112"	"Do I have to keep the actual hood part up?"
	"839840643"	"Ok, I'll admit there's a slight chance mistakes were made."
	"1158267669"	"Should I just go for two?"
	"3691025071"	"Does it make me quiet too? "
	"2869404217"	"What's a Kaya?"
	"1001963432"	"Oh, they go together."
	"1287622462"	"Enough's enough."
	"508453977"	"Have you heard the sound this thing makes?"
	"1766413519"	"I'll try not to forget I have this."
	"4030727541"	"Let's be honest. We don't buy these for the taste. But you have to admit it's pretty good."
	"2269591011"	"And I control both of them? Interesting."
	"421765184"	"Are we sure we're the good guys?"
	"1847890134"	"Like I didn't have enough."
	"4146970988"	"Everyone likes healing."
	"2150298106"	"They'll sell anything to anyone these days."
	"278260843"	"I really like the heft."
	"1737678077"	"This has to be a fake, right?"
	"123032856"	"So much more makes sense now."
	"1884448142"	"Oh you've got this one?"
	"3915068468"	"I liked the color."
	"2656830626"	"Explain how this works again."
	"3707137"	"Observer Wards kind of weird me out."
	"2000658839"	"You never know..."
	"3996577837"	"Wait. Can I have my gold back?"
	"2570174651"	"See? Sometimes scary things can be beautiful."
	"160357674"	"How about one for each finger?"
	"2122968508"	"Not quite as good as Kaden's, but I'll take it. "
	"2160937431"	"I've heard about this stuff..."
	"4157241665"	"Much less restrictive than I thought."
	"432281709"	"Can't go wrong with the classics."
	"2275446222"	"They always come in handy."
	"4037524824"	"Fire on the inside, fire on the outside... It's all the same to me."
	"1773071586"	"Let's get ready already."
	"2383856101"	"Kind of a dirty trick, but war's war."
	"4178702707"	"Yeah. That'll cut."
	"2580969622"	"They just go together nicely."
	"4006692864"	"That's an interesting name. What does it mean?"
	"2010651066"	"What do you mean it's a limited stock?"
	"14625068"	"Why do they call it a sheep stick?"
	"2663103631"	"They won't expect this."
	"3921447961"	"This is what happens when they push me too far."
	"1890966947"	"Skadi? Am I saying that right?"
	"2534273188"	"I won't run from a fight. But I will sneak towards one."
	"3758800946"	"Wonder if Mirana has one of these."
	"1238804968"	"Seems like an easy trade."
	"1053923710"	"Wait, wait. Will this boost both my souls?"
	"2816002244"	"This should give me all the time I need."
	"3504339026"	"Can you tell me how to use this thing?"
	"1320906225"	"Do these work on any kind of tree?"
	"968645991"	"Is there like an abridged version?"
	"2696219869"	"No blood magic? Nice. It's one of the good ones."
	"3618782283"	"That certainly is the scepter of scepters."
	"1192042970"	"Probably best to leave this thing closed."
	"805966156"	"I know I'm not, but I almost feel invincible."
	"1355651241"	"Why did I buy this?"
	"667592767"	"Aesthetics aside, it's pretty handy."
	"3200514437"	"This one's versatile."
	"3385116947"	"Oh, that's a nice set."
	"1470127280"	"This Aghanim guy really gets around."
	"547843110"	"Now all I need's an ugly sweater..."
	"3115203996"	"Let's see 'em make fun of the hat now."
	"3467185418"	"Some real bad vibes off this one."
	"1578504347"	"I don't feel right about this..."
	"688988173"	"Sage slayer..."
	"2078329706"	"I mean, they're gonna attack me anyway, right?"
	"216529916"	"Guess I'm gonna lean into it."
	"2515446342"	"Ok, I could get behind this."
	"3806960336"	"What? I've got grace..."
	"2089619315"	"Sure. Why not?"
	"193609701"	"It's not that unorthodox..."
	"1139003743"	"I'm just getting started."
	"3672801509"	"Another one down."
	"2918035571"	"Dead."
	"864626128"	"To the 7 hells with you!"
	"1150162246"	"That would have impressed Ritterfrau..."
	"3716629756"	"You fought well."
	"2860545130"	"Die with honor."
	"977234427"	"I did what I had to do."
	"1295538541"	"It was you or me."
	"771739784"	"I fear no one."
	"1526259742"	"Stay down."
	"3287396772"	"Well that was some unpleasent business..."
	"3036053810"	"You gave me no choice..."
	"714216593"	"Be thankful he didn't do worse."
	"1570055175"	"The sword was the honorable way."
	"3298588093"	"This is war. There are no heroes here."
	"3013297451"	"I told you to stay out of it."
	"589584570"	"Mourn your dead."
	"1411606572"	"How many is it gonna take?"
	"114459467"	"You wore out your welcome."
	"1909830621"	"I don't make the rules, just live by 'em."
	"3906789991"	"Don't worry. I'll say something nice."
	"2681983729"	"Few creeps short, huh?"
	"3198978813"	"Eh, just sword fodder."
	"665180999"	"I hope it's not true they have families."
	"1352854481"	"Not sure he earned that..."
	"3469114994"	"Sorry..."
	"3116453604"	"Should have stayed in your barracks."
	"549986142"	"Doesn't take much."
	"1473195976"	"Perfect timing."
	"3346018905"	"Like one of those candy-filled dolls you hit with sticks."
	"2960589519"	"How much gold is that?"
	"3800492456"	"Bram usually keeps track of that stuff."
	"4175549163"	"Need that gold."
	"1642627921"	"Easily dispatched..."
	"384807879"	"Hope Bram was taking notes."
	"2290820708"	"And that's how you do it..."
	"4287370994"	"Keep the coin coming..."
	"1720010568"	"I could do this all day."
	"293763038"	"No one's better than me... well, Kaden is, but he's not here so it doesn't count."
	"2168285775"	"I'll cut through 'em all..."
	"4131019481"	"Ending them was a mercy..."
	"2533217084"	"Too easy."
	"2400720421"	"Sorry friend..."
	"370231199"	"They're down."
	"1628862217"	"Got the money."
	"4285719210"	"They're dead."
	"2289422908"	"More coin."
	"293372806"	"Can't stop now."
	"1719382800"	"Gotta keep this up."
	"4140084865"	"Need to keep the money coming..."
	"621025403"	"Ha"
	"3154987457"	"Ha ha"
	"3406461271"	"Hn hn hm hm"
	"1433332980"	"Hnn."
	"577363042"	"Ahh"

	"3429350734"	"Hn hn hn hn ha ha"

	"2726136561"	"Wish Kaden could see me now..."
	"997514059"	"The strength of the Elydwrym... I can feel it."
	"1282665437"	"Slyrak hungers..."
	"3524755070"	"The thunder lends me it's strength..."
	"2769309416"	"I'll rise to any challenge."
	"1008279378"	"Getting stronger with every battle..."
	"1260269508"	"Dragon. Demon. God... I'll face them all."
	"3684774485"	"Well earned."
	"2896560835"	"Maybe I can control Slyrak now..."
	"3428944678"	"That's a good sign."
	"3144072112"	"Wurmblood comes in handy."
	"577759754"	"Gotta stay mindful of what I might become."
	"1432935068"	"Time to cut loose."
	"3406581567"	"See? Nothing to it."
	"3154870185"	"I'll be grizzled in no time."
	"620899859"	"I wear it well."
	"1376067205"	"Who says it's gotta be hard?"
	"3266970388"	"I'm just gonna relish that for a sec."
	"3483714325"	"I failed..."
	"1454117551"	"I let you all down..."
	"564863545"	"This wasn't supposed to happen."
	"2016645503"	"I should probably just tell Mirana how I feel... which is stupid because she already KNOWS how I feel so I really shouldn't have to say anything.  This really shouldn't be this hard.  Gods, why am I thinking about Mirana when I need to be focusing on the ancients...The ancients.  One red. One blue.  Mirana looks great in blue.  Godsdamn it, focus!"
	"3778724037"	"Luna says she's changed but I don't buy it.  She massacred Fymryn's family.  She occupied Coedwig and demanded forced conversion... it's not just wrong... it's despicable.  "
	"2520641619"	"I don't agree with Invoker about a lot of things, but if there's one thing we're on the same page about it's that Selemene is a monster.  The world would be better off without her."
	"140076528"	"Gods I hope that Mirana doesn't get sucked back into her little moon cult.  Selemene is a narcissist, Luna is a war criminal, and the Dark Moon Order are abunch of reglious zealots... if she goes back to them, it's like she's learned nothing..."
	"2136888678"	"One of these days I'm gonna go to White Spire with Axe and get drunk.   Like really drunk.  Like, let's get into a fight with a criminal mastermind and in killing them end up taking over their organization drunk."
	"3864462556"	"It's been too long since I've gone back to Dragon Hold... See Ritterfrau... see Kaden... see my friends.  My family.  I need to do them all proud."
	"2437952586"	"I should take Fymryn to Weeping Rose... if she really spent her whole life in Coedwig it would blow her mind.  Oh man, I should take Marci too, I could introduce her to Wei, those two would hit it off like crazy..."
	"32451035"	"It's hard... rectifying who I am, what I am, now.  It's getting more difficult  to tell where Slyrak ends and I begin... which means I'm responsible for what happened at Lethsham.  A city full of innocent people burned alive.  I don't know why Slyrak attacked, I may never know... but for the rest of my life I have to live what he did... and I have to make peace that people are right to hate me for it."
	"1994922317"	"Maybe I shouldn't have given that kid in Hauptstadt the dragon's tooth... growing up in Dragon Hold wasn't easy.  You call those men and women your brothers... look up to them, and then some of them just... don't come home.  It's almost cruel: we give a home to those that lost families only to give them a new family that they get to lose all over again."
	"372215976"	"Axe has Goodkind.  I have Bram.  Mirana has Marcie.  Only one thing left to do.  Start a band."
	"2704459729"	"On the move."
	"943429227"	"I'll go where I'm needed."
	"1329374973"	"Moving."
	"3843969224"	"Moving."
	"3512218462"	"Ready for action."
	"2791244744"	"Take me to the fight."
	"1062621810"	"On my way."
	"1213293284"	"Let's go."
	"1786562463"	"Let's go."
	"3639508853"	"Gotta move."
	"2951303139"	"On it."
	"3475949062"	"I'm ready."
	"3089757840"	"Stay alert."
	"555788074"	"The enemy could be anywhere."
	"1445435324"	"Let's get into some trouble."
	"3359834655"	"Right."
	"1168720321"	"Right."
	"3208917641"	"I like it."
	"642605875"	"I should probably go over here."
	"1363825573"	"Do we need backup?"
	"3254079028"	"It could be this way."
	"3069345442"	"It's why we're here."
	"3825440197"	"Pleasure."
	"3891821787"	"I don't back down from a fight..."
	"2129735009"	"Can't stop now..."
	"167124471"	"Gotta push through this..."
	"2542962772"	"This isn't over yet..."
	"3767908546"	"The team's counting on me..."
	"2040326520"	"Come on Slyrak..."
	"245094894"	"This is a bad idea..."
	"2653209727"	"I need to get my hands on a tango..."
	"3911447785"	"This isn't my finest moment..."
	"2313452812"	"I'm moving, I'm moving..."
	"941526901"	"No mana."
	"2702696143"	"Out of mana."
	"3591433817"	"Not enough mana."
	"1215593466"	"No mana."
	"1064520556"	"Out of mana."
	"2793020118"	"Not enough mana."
	"3514640960"	"No mana!"
	"1103247313"	"Out of mana!"
	"918882119"	"Not enough mana!"
	"902447138"	"Not yet."
	"2898465176"	"Not ready."
	"3687063822"	"It's not time."
	"1168159917"	"Not yet."
	"849839163"	"Not ready."
	"2880361857"	"It's not time."
	"3702121751"	"Not yet!"
	"1276573830"	"Not ready!"
	"991021072"	"It's not time!"
	"2827017469"	"Un"
	"831098183"	"Un"
	"1183759825"	"Un"
	"3639224434"	"Ah"
	"2951551204"	"Un"
	"920930654"	"Un"
	"1105426888"	"Ah"
	"3512493145"	"Ah"
	"2791003343"	"Ah"
	"3332169002"	"Ooh"
	"3069585829"	"Ah"
	"805271583"	"Gah"
	"62910405"	"Ah"
	"1963201210"	"I need this."
	"3960292096"	"This could make the diffference."
	"2601153430"	"I'll take any edge I can get."
	"3025101073"	"This might sound strange, but...you got any magic pants?"
	"4281265222"	"I really shouldn't have closed down that bar last night..."
	"1713880572"	"If Mirana thinks I'm a handful she should go out drinking with Donte... that guy is a force of nature."
	"287346026"	"I wonder what Fymryn's up to?"
	"2848960605"	"Regeneration!"
	"818340327"	"The Thunder won't let me die..."
	"2942228863"	"Alright let's try that again"
	"911706309"	"Gotta get back in the fight."
	"1095809107"	"I can't let the others down..."
	"3744738800"	"Death is for lesser men."
	"2821922150"	"Kaden wouldn't give up, and neither will I..."
	"825904348"	"I got something to prove..."
	"1178434634"	"Well, if I didn't have a chip on my shoulder before, I certainly have one now..."
	"3598868955"	"Bram's not gonna let me live that down..."
	"2709868877"	"OK, let's not do that again..."
	"3242383528"	"Most men would have quit.  Good thing I'm not most men."
	"3058034750"	"I gotta be honest. Not my favorite place to be."
	"793557380"	"That all went a lot better in my head."
	"1481345298"	"Should see the other guy."
	"3324976305"	"Pretty as ever."
	"2972199975"	"No hangover or anything."
	"673283485"	"I should probably learn from that."
	"1596345611"	"I guess they took it personally."
	"3482931354"	"Who says you only live once?"
	"4175671116"	"I've been waiting for this Abaddon..."
	"1642790646"	"Let the mists of Avernus die with you..."
	"384683616"	"Give Herzog my regards."
	"2290703299"	"I'll take you both on!"
	"4287523669"	"I'm not afraid of ghosts..."
	"1720138479"	"You're haunting the wrong man."
	"293603961"	"Heard you got skills... let's see you back it up."
	"2168395752"	"Wei will be free of your influence..."
	"4130875262"	"Make as many copies as you want, it won't make a difference."
	"2533338779"	"You failed Zet."
	"3791166989"	"I'm not scared of a brute like you..."
	"2029113271"	"I'll give Goodkind my condolences."
	"267845409"	"You don't scare me, Bane."
	"2442291842"	"There's no nightmare worse than what I've been through, Bane."
	"3868547604"	"The only person lighting things on fire is me...."
	"2140933038"	"You're grounded."
	"144390968"	"You fought well Beastmaster."
	"2552506025"	"I hunt where I want."
	"4012054079"	"The Flayed Twins must be stopped!"
	"3184721240"	"Your seeking days are over."
	"3403009486"	"Should have stayed in Revtel, Gondar."
	"1406966900"	"No one hunts a Dragon Knight."
	"618376418"	"Go home, Brewmaster."
	"3133094209"	"Picked the wrong side, buddy."
	"3451390423"	"You picked a fight with the wrong guy..."
	"1420908653"	"Psh, thought you were supposed to be some tough guy..."
	"599156987"	"I hate spiders."
	"3003741546"	"I'll be getting web off me for a week..."
	"3289269756"	"Always wanted to see how I'd measure up in the Omex Arena..."
	"2764688409"	"Guess I'm champion now..."
	"3553557647"	"You're not a knight, you're a monster."
	"1254599989"	"Just because you ride a mount and wear armor doesn't make you a knight..."
	"1036033443"	"You're done enslaving people!"
	"2745436160"	"The Knights of the Fold need to be stopped!"
	"3567466646"	"You were an honorable man once.  You deserved an honorable death."
	"1303013676"	"Now you can rest."
	"984439226"	"All the fancy toys in the world can't save you."
	"2853323819"	"I'll carve you out of that armor."
	"3709170877"	"Sorry Rylai."
	"3951581918"	"Lina's probably not gonna be happy about this..."
	"2626644552"	"You think you're some great military mind?"
	"92683250"	"You're good.  Not as good as you think you are, but good."
	"1921059684"	"Oh Mireska... we gonna keep doing this?"
	"3974471367"	"I thought you learned your lesson in White Spire."
	"2615324241"	"Tough lady."
	"49020907"	"You made me work for it."
	"1978453885"	"You can't save yourself, Dazzle."
	"3847475948"	"Your tricks couldn't save you."
	"2455036538"	"I'm sending you back to where you came from!"
	"4069747615"	"Slyrak's soul is staying right where it is..."
	"2241092361"	"This isn't the way to save your people..."
	"480053939"	"I have a lot of respect for the Oglodi... just none for you."
	"1805269541"	"Alright Doom.   Let's see if you're all talk."
	"4127108998"	"Give my regards to Terrorblade when you're rotting in hell."
	"2197397264"	"OK, this is just weird..."
	"468766378"	"Die, imposter!"
	"1828191804"	"You should have Mirana give you some pointers..."
	"4232635309"	"I'm not prey for you to hunt."
	"2337264443"	"He was strong, I'll give him that..."
	"3653122140"	"I don't think the others will take too kindly to that."
	"2931361994"	"You're being used, Earthshaker, can't you see that?"
	"934304112"	"You may shake the ground, but Slyrak shakes the heavens."
	"1085762022"	"It was an honor to fight you, Titan."
	"3738434629"	"They say you forged the world, but the Thunder is the real pillar of creation."
	"2849295571"	"How could an ember hurt the Father of Fire."
	"819830121"	"You'll be with your brothers soon."
	"1205513727"	"Seem like a nice lady, sorry about stabbing you."
	"3613765742"	"I'm gonna feel guilty about that later..."
	"2690810104"	"You call yourself a Fundamental, but just see a sad man playing at godhood."
	"3232041245"	"The Fundamentals are nothing compared to the pillar of creation."
	"3080862091"	"If I have to kill you to get what I want from Clazureme, then so be it."
	"782985265"	"I wasn't looking to fight the Lord of Time, but if it's what has to happen, then so be it."
	"1504467111"	"Cute paintbrush."
	"3351825668"	"Stick painting pictures, war isn't for."
	"2966420882"	"Rockets.  Really."
	"700886056"	"What the hell is that thing..."
	"1589746878"	"God help us if that one ever pairs up with Mireska..."
	"3464397103"	"Hope I don't have rabies...."
	"3111760313"	"An honorable man deserves an honorable death."
	"1195185618"	"You're a credit to your tribe, Huskar.  Find peace in death."
	"809116996"	"Time to turn off the light."
	"2838721790"	"I don't trust anything that reminds me of moonlight."
	"3727967336"	"Do you love me?"
	"1079038411"	"I'm done being your pawn!"
	"928506205"	"Slyrak is your soverign, Jakiro..."
	"2925441255"	"Two headed dragon... that's something you don't see everyday..."
	"3646521457"	"Yurnero, be reasonable, I don't want to kill you."
	"1239850464"	"This was your choice Yurnero, not mine."
	"1054977398"	"You say you keep the light, but you've let Selemene run rampant for years."
	"1579558035"	"You Fundamentals are all the same...braggarts who can't back it up."
	"690033669"	"Your crew is dead Kunkka, accept it."
	"2955429311"	"You couldn't save your crew, and you couldn't save yourself."
	"3341776169"	"Any empire that threatens the Helio Imperium is my enemy."
	"1498144906"	"Galanius is a tyrant, and Stone Hall deserves to fall."
	"776785948"	"You had so much potential Leshrac..."
	"3074785702"	"You and invoker are cut from the same cloth."
	"3225596208"	"Die, Lich!"
	"1358802081"	"I hate the undead."
	"670735415"	"Die, monster!"
	"2384917997"	"You poor tormented bastard..."
	"4179740027"	"I'm nothing like you, Lina..."
	"1613272257"	"I'll never forgive you for what you did."
	"388998231"	"That is one freaky hand."
	"2303406580"	"You're not gonna make it to Weeping Rose, lion..."
	"4266393954"	"Don't worry, I'll take care of your bear."
	"1732595928"	"I gotta take that bear back to Dragon Hold..."
	"272785486"	"You're a monster luna!"
	"2164096479"	"You'll answer for what you did to the coedwig..."
	"4160376137"	"And so ends Slom's dynasty..."
	"2537407660"	"He deserved better than to die like this."

	"3407325177"	"Let's see if you're all talk Wu-Kong."
	"1377760835"	"You travelled a long way just to die here."
	"622446293"	"What the hell are you..."
	"3145552758"	"Ugh, I think some of you got in my mouth..."
	"3430573024"	"No more songs."
	"1433612890"	"Think I'll skip the encore..."
	"578028236"	"It's not personal, Prophet..."
	"2999656285"	"A friend of mine once told me that those who go looking for trouble in the forest tend to find it."
	"3318493131"	"I wont let you hurt anyone else!"
	"2769004078"	"Die, plague bearer!"
	"3524040376"	"I'm not easy prey."

	"2724618807"	"I don't know if that thing is a spider or a crab, but it is definitely dead..."
	"3579925153"	"You're no invoker."
	"1281884955"	"With two heads you'd think you'd show more sense."
	"997143437"	"Another religious zealot taken care of..."
	"2882547228"	"all seeing one... more like all dying one... that sounded way more cooler in my head than when I said it out loud..."
	"3705085578"	"Your riddles won't save you now."
	"3930730729"	"Some prophacey's aren't meant to be fullfilled."
	"2639069311"	"Your machinations end here..."
	"71586245"	"The Thunder protects this world..."
	"1933795667"	"Sorry, old friend."
	"3978818800"	"If you couldn't beat me in a drinking contest, what are the odds you'd beat me in sword fight?"
	"2585838694"	"Maybe you should reconsider having my name on my list..."
	"53056988"	"One of these days you're gonna stop trying to kill me..."
	"1949214026"	"Looks like I found the real one."
	"3834755291"	"Nice try, Lancer."
	"2476116045"	"I'd think twice about being reborn."
	"4082172328"	"Rise from the ashes, and I'll just burn you down again."
	"2220241214"	"You're not part of the Thunder, just an abberation."
	"492789892"	"You'll make a nice snack for Slyrak."
	"1784172562"	"The dead have no place amongst the living..."
	"4097623473"	"Lady Anshu will be pleased."
	"2201744679"	"Maniac's like you need to be put down."
	"439526557"	"Viper sends his regards."
	"1832227851"	"Queen of Pain, please, you're a walking cliche."
	"4253714842"	"The Court of Ristul will never have power here!"
	"2324543756"	"If you're the one guarding the narrow maze, I shouldn't fear death at all..."
	"3632026219"	"All that bluster, and so little followthrough."
	"2944099069"	"I hate that sneaky little bastard..."
	"913453895"	"I'm not afraid of the Jasper Circle."
	"1098187729"	"You'll always be a second rate Aghanim."
	"3742471794"	"Looks like your father was right, you ARE a dissapointment."
	"2820056804"	"I'll finish what Lina started..."
	"824178526"	"You see any desert around here?"
	"2711677647"	"Tell your friends in the Court of Ristul, that this plane is off limits."
	"3244778282"	"Die, Nevermore!"
	"3059766204"	"You're con man, shaman... you don't belong on the battlefield."
	"795410950"	"Dime store hexes aren't going to cut it here."
	"1483616912"	"You never should have left the Tyler Estate."
	"3322586931"	"I'm not some mage for you to torment..."
	"2970458021"	"You remind me of Invoker.  I hate invoker."
	"671401503"	"Shut up already..."
	"3099319182"	"You got lucky in White Spire... but here there's no crimelord to save you."
	"1191149541"	"I'm sending you to dark reef where you belong...."
	"838356851"	"Sorry Mortimer, your rider didn't have common sense."
	"2834374345"	"That poor dragon toad..."
	"3757452895"	"Cowards like you don't belong on the battlefield/"
	"1100135420"	"You won't pick us off one by one!"
	"685997618"	"You betrayed your oath Sven!"
	"2984914824"	"No more games, Sven, Let's finish this now."
	"3246447367"	"I'll send you back to Foulfell!"
	"1363134102"	"You already know how this ends, demon."
	"641267200"	"Back to the depths with you!"
	"3799796323"	"The only reason you brag about bar fights is because you never got in one with me"
	"208808783"	"Well you're a big boy, aren't you..."
	"2450964204"	"Wish I had Kaden's sword, make this go a lot faster."
	"3843133050"	"Let the dead stay buried."
	"2082004928"	"I'll fight the Dead God's minions wherever they shows up."
	"186642262"	"Woah that was a big bear..."
	"2611016391"	"My armor ok?"
	"3970417233"	"Well that lady was intense..."
	"3193317686"	"Your quarell is with your sister, not me."
	"3377535392"	"Not a dragon, but close enough..."
	"1347962906"	"I wonder how Father would use that thing's corpse."
	"660568204"	"I'll need Father to take a look at this armor."
	"3107712303"	"God I hate acid."
	"3460095417"	"OK, that thing was creepy."
	"1463127043"	"I'll send you screaming back into the Narrow Maze."
	"540195989"	"I'll apologize to your brothers."
	"2962071812"	"Now to hunt down the others..."
	"3347747218"	"What's a golem to an Eldwyrm?"
	"2806847607"	"Buddy, you're no Invoker."
	"3494521057"	"Should have weaved a better ending for yourself..."
	"1229158747"	"I won't be defined by fate."
	"1044662733"	"You'd think someone so cocky would have been able to back it up..."
	"2686508142"	"Better than Traxex?  Maybe. Better than Mirana?  Never."
	"3609718008"	"Don't make me do this Auroth."
	"1311685954"	"God, I'm gonna have to explain this to Bram."
	"959024596"	"Well, that's one less crazy bastard to deal with."
	"2845216837"	"Nothing personal, Doc."
	"3734085843"	"Should have statyed dead, Osterion."
	"3893137072"	"You butchered your people Osterion... and now you're gonna answer for it."
	"2668346918"	"You're an asshole, Zeus."
	"100855708"	"Should stuck to being a swan."
	"2376212867"	"What has gotten into you, Marci?!"
	"3668331658"	"So this is Aghanim's Scepter..."
	"1135549744"	"The power in this thing is immesurable..."
	"2109953099"	"Shitty wizard..."
	"2633638997"	"Of course Bram's late. "
	"99841519"	"Ugh, where's Bram when you need him."
	"1928611193"	"Time to save the world.  Again."
	"3968913626"	"My Sword. My life."
	"2610421836"	"After everything I've seen? Piece of cake."
	"43954678"	"After Mirana's story about that cave... To be honest? I was expecting worse."
	"1972994400"	"Look. I'm not big on the Ancients. But if the wrong side loses, a whole lotta people get hurt."
	"3844513009"	"That's strange. The last thing I remember...."
	"2451680359"	"Have I...been here before?"
	"4075169154"	"Let me guess. I do all the hard stuff and Slyrak gets the glory? Sounds right."
	"2246120724"	"Ready to do some good for once, you dour beast?"
	"484983982"	"The thunder might not care about this fight, but I do."
	"1810854968"	"Just a thought here, but has anyone tried negotiating?"
	"4119585179"	"Let's get this done with minimal bloodshed. Talking to you, Slyrak."
	"2190266637"	"If we kill an Ancient, maybe we can go our separate ways."
	"461734071"	"Ever notice how fountains make you feel really good, but also really weird?"
	"1820504097"	"Oh, yeah... This place. What day is it?"
	"4231900592"	"You know, I show up, and it's like, people just wanna see the dragon. And...that hurts. Yeah."
	"3426268812"	"Gotta get outta here..."
	"1429333814"	"Hope I get there in one piece..."
	"255034950"	"Thanks."
	"2520438780"	"Thank you."
	"3778930538"	"Preciate it."
	"1692991353"	"I need help!"
	"4259425987"	"We're under attack!"
	"3022720062"	"I think you've had enough."
	"2714544526"	"I think you've had enough."
	"757226884"	"You wouldn't last a day in Dragon Hold."
	"1512402194"	"Am I gonna have to eat you later? I hate that."
	"3292657841"	"Are you gonna apologize or what?"
	"3007760423"	"There's something about your face...I don't like."
	"709859741"	"Cheer up. You'll be dead soon."
	"1565042955"	"Stop. Just...stop."
	"3455562906"	"I'd say drink your sorrows away. But you'd have nothing left."
	"3136324620"	"I can see this conversation's going nowhere..."
	"3661041129"	"You shouldn't make me angry..."
	"2905619839"	"This is why we get up in the morning."
	"2453125537"	"I don't get it."
	"188672027"	"Where's the fun in that?"
	"2084165773"	"Call me willing but skeptical."
	"2224607785"	"Pfha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha."
	"2331454036"	"Trust me, I'm worth it."
	"335444974"	"We'll both make out like bandits."
	"1694059384"	"You know, you're all right."
	"3892335395"	"For Dragon Hold!"
	"1896415897"	"Time to celebrate!"
	"101593615"	"Let's get Bram over here to tell everyone how great I am..."
	"1708591906"	"Through me, a little mouse finds a way."
	"4242430616"	"Through this little mouse, I find a way."
	"2346281486"	"The embers of infinity flow through me."
	"364773293"	"This mouse is my vessel."
	"1656409915"	"With the help of my blood, even manflesh is formidable."
	"4222852737"	"Our wounds will heal, little mouse."
	"5973623"	"The manflesh will never return."
	"2572318669"	"Stay inside, little mouse."
	"2304235374"	"Armies become ashes."
	"274630356"	"Feel my fury!"
	"1733932610"	"The father of fire speaks!"
	"4181533665"	"I bring destruction!"
	"2386170743"	"You should have run."
	"389235405"	"Face the fate of nations."
	"1614049883"	"Just a spark."
	"4035669962"	"Fear my inferno."
	"2274123612"	"The cinder gust blows."
	"3880507065"	"Burn."
	"1943267349"	"Burn."
	"2420958767"	"The bellows of ruin find you."
	"155563925"	"Your end will be quick. But not painless."
	"865914087"	"Beware a dragon's tail."
	"2861931869"	"All insects to me."
	"3717377483"	"Silence!"
	"1140209768"	"Show the proper respect."
	"888211710"	"Don't waste my breath."
	"2918734148"	"You are nothing to me."
	"3125049437"	"This is not rebirth."
	"592259559"	"What comes next, little mouse, you must face alone."
	"2358560340"	"You could not control your prisoners, and now I must stir."
	"362649582"	"Your compulsion itself seeks a form of order."
	"4244517595"	"Did you hear the Thunder while you slept?"
	"317740023"	"Even your perceptions of time are only one shade of truth."
	"4115169008"	"I didn't take you for one who cared, mighty Io."
	"3800614787"	"Be careful who you choose for allies, Invoker. Who would mourn your passing?"
	"2509240085"	"You're too clever for your own good, wizard. Too clever for anyone's good."
	"210151087"	"Together we will burn their towers down."
	"3856991130"	"I should demand supplication for your gifts."
	"199975606"	"The little mouse stirs inside me. No love lost here."
	"3964882865"	"Gods are far too human, Mars. Such weakness."
	"3383071808"	"My plans did not account for you, Princess.."
	"3198330070"	"The easy solution would be to dispose of you, Princess. But I would never hear the end of it."
	"1353500154"	"You remain limited by the scope of your dimensions, Oracle."
	"3469234265"	"I don't worry about the contents of your visions, Oracle."
	"3117375695"	"Necessity creates strange times indeed."
	"549859701"	"Your end can wait, Terrorblade. For a time."
	"1472266723"	"You misunderstand the nature of the Confluence, Inai."
	"3346930802"	"Your song is different than ours, now."
	"2960731364"	"Bereft of the true song, it's no wonder you feel compelled to create."
	"3502155009"	"We were not meant to be shackled to a mortal life, Zeus."
	"4191504539"	"Wisest of all the mice, this one."
	"3306137283"	"Grrrr"
	"1543960441"	"Grrrr"
	"721537007"	"Grrrr"
	"3043316300"	"Grrrr"
	"3261227738"	"Grrrr"
	"1533752160"	"Grrrr"
	"745276406"	"Grrrr"
	"2779311712"	"Arcane power."
	"3742886353"	"Arcane power."
	"1017233370"	"I will not refuse it."
	"3656513061"	"Run little mouse."
	"971691919"	"Run little mouse."
	"1090037663"	"Face me if you dare."
	"939497225"	"Your suffering ends."
	"2845508266"	"Enough."
	"3734778428"	"I did not come to play."
	"1200972678"	"Feel my hate."
	"814895888"	"Cower."
	"2687323777"	"Only a fool stands before an eldwurm."
	"3609886231"	"You are nothing."
	"3085826034"	"You had time enough."
	"3236611940"	"You cannot prepare for this."
	"1508087518"	"Now you die."
	"786736712"	"Time for a bite."
	"2961191915"	"This is your end."
	"3347514237"	"Enough hiding."
	"1586385607"	"Die."
	"696869457"	"The Thunder takes."
	"3107356608"	"Surrender."
	"3459338070"	"Fools!"
	"2629870641"	"For my ire."
	"3613374029"	"Rah!"
	"1044124536"	"Haa!"
	"1228612590"	"Raaa."
	"2391317970"	"Ha!"
	"394382440"	"Haa!"
	"1619459326"	"Haa!"
	"4276250973"	"Haaa!"
	"2313509323"	"Haaa."
	"283904113"	"Haa."
	"1743468775"	"Haaa."
	"1725222501"	"Come closer."
	"4292714463"	"Are you afraid?"
	"2296033097"	"So certain you can kill me?"
	"381565674"	"I fear nothing of this world."
	"1639516796"	"Time to cross over."
	"4172307398"	"It isn't death you fear."
	"2411162448"	"I still have reach."
	"520648385"	"You're not leaving here."
	"3168073853"	"Blink dagger."
	"635283911"	"The swiftest wing."
	"4030305367"	"A note worth saving."
	"1764804077"	"For my pleasure."
	"506983803"	"Rune power is drawn to me."
	"3193735802"	"A worthy bounty."
	"659938240"	"The thunder knows...I can't resist."
	"2723420833"	"Any fools inside?"
	"995969819"	"A fitting perch."
	"1280998285"	"This will be ours."
	"3527339566"	"Surrender your holdings."
	"2772033208"	"It all belongs to me."
	"1009815298"	"The laws of this land do not apply to me."
	"67911078"	"Face the fire and the fury."
	"2634378268"	"Feel my wrath."
	"3926023306"	"You have no future here."
	"3092526833"	"I only need to win, not survive."

	"2958954486"	"The balance grows."
	"3344514912"	"Almost enough for a bauble."
	"1582329562"	"Necessary."
	"693591628"	"Unconvincing."
	"3119006685"	"Well done..."

	"1316788225"	"Fly."
	"3614820795"	"My eyes see."
	"2691889453"	"On ember wings."
	"1041656974"	"With the will of thunder."
	"1225874456"	"Soon, a path of fire."
	"3491237282"	"To great ends."
	"2803842356"	"I scorch a greater path."
	"933240997"	"They fear the fall of my shadow."
	"1084690483"	"A silence before the firestorm."
	"543201750"	"This is the way."
	"1466411328"	"I blaze a wide trail."
	"3463379194"	"Dragons have no need for stealth."
	"3110717548"	"Should I burn the trees?"
	"655187407"	"Destroy all cover."
	"1342860633"	"Where are they hiding?"
	"3372432611"	"I can smell them."
	"3187936373"	"An easy course."

	"1508677510"	"We only need time."
	"3236283964"	"Down a few scales..."
	"3085104810"	"I relent."
	"660466491"	"Pain fuels rage."
	"1348131757"	"Faster."
	"815616584"	"This danger will pass."

	"1781653387"	"This is nothing to my stash."
	"490139421"	"Fear not. I won't return for my gold."
	"2203220670"	"It draws my eye."
	"804465878"	"Regeneration!"
	"3069869420"	"Even more potent than mine."
	"2391851436"	"As it ever was."

	"1621008512"	"How came I to be here now?"
	"4277810467"	"Perhaps the little mouse is sleeping."
	"2182072696"	"All your ancient schemes...for nothing, Warden."
	"1812047956"	"Your efforts are meaningless, rider."
	"2237795681"	"Go back to sleep, ancient one."
	"1802267725"	"You never understood your place, titan."
	"2362720586"	"You were just a flicker of my glory."
	"1964677397"	"Was that an actual mouse?"
	"3950906550"	"An unexpected challenge."
	"2625190944"	"This one is unkillable. But we can at least delay its plans."
	"1920425228"	"Face your punishment, wizard."
	"3804774557"	"Punished at last for what you set in motion."
	"2513399819"	"This should have happened in your nest."
	"2956569594"	"Keeper of nothing. My light burns brighter."
	"1580714710"	"Foolish child."
	"3075764195"	"The mouse inside is satisfied."
	"1499074255"	"I fear no Ash Legion."
	"3202491336"	"I feel...a distant sense of sadness."
	"3727010349"	"Your eternal reign begins."
	"3645402676"	"If you saw this coming, you're a bigger fool than I thought."
	"927338264"	"You should have stayed at your post."
	"2818118281"	"A shame. I longed to see another form."
	"3865250940"	"Only a distant relative."
	"2137677254"	"Not even a bloodline this diminished deserves to be a mount."
	"141389136"	"Your plans were doomed long before I came along."
	"2517235955"	"Just another demon after all."
	"3775842405"	"Out of my way...for a time."
	"251701577"	"Your mind was warped by the will of the stone."
	"2680141016"	"We both suffer under an Ancient's spell..."
	"3904406606"	"A merciful end to your cautionary tale."
	"4149102519"	"This little one surprised even me."
	"4217918553"	"The scepter of Aghanim."
	"1650525667"	"I claim this scepter."
	"1544375448"	"Insignificant wizard."
	"2803872172"	"When wings fail me..."

	"2469836505"	"My existence defines yours."
	"3828450895"	"Don't count your hatchlings before they're fed."
	"1955503070"	"A wurmling could have done better."
	"59353928"	"Pathetic."
	"1666065069"	"You dishonor yourself."
	"3812574471"	"I am not so disadvantaged."
	"2050364605"	"You are less than a mouse."
	"221324331"	"What transpires in that tiny brain?"
