which have not been changed in the transition to Dota 2 Reborn.
When running under the Source 1 engine, that did not prevent
the game from working because the engine was not designed around
the full capabilities of the minimum spec for graphic cards.
However, Dota 2 Reborn relies on graphics features such as vertex textures and shader model 3.0
and so adherence to the minimum spec is a stronger requirement
than it was in Source 1 Dota 2. Unfortunately this means that Dota 2 Reborn
will not be able to run on some graphics cards from 2006 or before.

	"728633161"	"Alright. Time to kill the Ancient."
	"1550401503"	"I have the skill of a Kazurai. And the attention span of a bird. Which way is the Ancient again?"
	"3311431269"	"Focus! Get the eye of the tiger, people. Actual tiger people should just keep doing what they're doing."

	"1325582925"	"Guys you want me to kill are this way, right?"
	"939915995"	"Let's go bust up a moon rock."
	"2701962081"	"Ready to go."

	"1226886154"	"They let you just SELL these? To kids?"
	"1042807964"	"Dragon stance."
	"2804854054"	"Yeah, people just love drums. Said the psychopath."
	"3492388272"	"I really need to find some invisible stuff."
	"1083605025"	"So like what if I don't wanna hit the second time? Does it force me?"
	"932294839"	"Say 'wet your beak' and you lose a finger."
	"1465268562"	"How do I hold it?"
	"542181828"	"Hmm, a bit too close to flying."
	"3109574782"	"Punch with it, eat with it. What can't it do?"
	"3462359272"	"I only use it for serious business. I swear."
	"1346108747"	"Wait, do I WANNA see everything around me?"

	"1502458208"	"Fill 'em up."
	"780829174"	"How fast does this heart beat?"
	"404205461"	"Is it honorable? No. Is it perfect? Absolutely."
	"1863360259"	"I'm a bit more of a free hand."
	"4128886457"	"Does it work for anybody or do I gotta believe?"
	"2166292015"	"Better than the NOOSE of defiance Imperia planned for me..."
	"528116620"	"Why's it called that?"
	"1753045786"	"Where's the blade? Gonna end up cutting my own leg off."
	"4050913952"	"Kaya? Ok, yeah."

	"107043533"	"I guess I'm a healer too."
	"1902537307"	"Are these names literal? This one makes me think yes."
	"3899603937"	"Doesn't this belong to someone?"
	"2674396023"	"Wait, is there more than one?"

	"3563415932"	"Neat horns."
	"2109276326"	"Nothing I hate about this."
	"180236336"	"I heard about chain lightening, but this is ridiculous."
	"2478268810"	"Fine. I'll see what they're on about."
	"3836760348"	"Is this for when I'm dead or...?"
	"2060764351"	"I can't believe I never thought of this."
	"231994409"	"Does this even do anything special?"
	"2497357203"	"Gosh there's so many..."
	"3822949637"	"Is this the one I want?"
	"1935837332"	"Not really my speed."
	"73775106"	"Got anymore o' that mango?"
	"1688351207"	"Doesn't this belong to that really angry lady?"
	"329580913"	"Yeah, let's get it."
	"2326548683"	"That's a real fancy hat."
	"4255866973"	"What the hell's a cornucopia anyway?"
	"1674573310"	"That thing looks kinda heavy..."
	"348702056"	"Dunno what it does, but it looks real neat."
	"4207322180"	"You want a disperser, talk to Gralla after a mid-day feast."
	"1786362325"	"Just like a REAL princess."
	"494831939"	"Khanda don't get the hype... "
	"1334796836"	"Uh why's it called Parasma?"
	"948458162"	"You got any non-creepy masks around?"
	"2709586696"	"Do I box? You kiddin? ME? I mean I do now."
	"1137754081"	"This feels wrong."
	"3671715419"	"More than enough."
	"2917064397"	"They like to use these in The Cage..."
	"867847022"	"Hope I'm right about this..."
	"1153268728"	"The sooner we all go home..."
	"3719572034"	"It's a bargain."
	"2863864532"	"A double dose."
	"973866821"	"Almost sells itself."
	"1292580819"	"We'll tear this kingdom down."
	"768392758"	"Radiance"
	"1523289760"	"I can always push through."
	"3284328218"	"Could do a lotta good with this..."
	"3032870796"	"Don't wait for a chance, make one."
	"715225647"	"Kraw always said power comes from within..."
	"1571179193"	"I got one kinda like this."
	"1116955446"	"You're wormfood, pal."
	"3684315788"	"Who turned out the lights? It was me."
	"2895970842"	"Pecked... to death."
	"855218105"	"I'm impressed that worked."
	"1174316847"	"I did that. That was me."
	"3707238037"	"Killed by a bird."
	"2884683267"	"You died like a dog. Choking on a bird."
	"995089298"	"Annnd you're dead."
	"1279847172"	"Who's chicken now?"
	"747594465"	"Pshhh, richly deserved."
	"1535660663"	"One for the good guys..."
	"3263235021"	"When you get to hell, tell 'em a bird sent you."
	"3045471067"	"Enjoy your flight to hell."
	"736274168"	"You were definitely asking for it."
	"1558550126"	"That'll teach ya."
	"3320629204"	"Compiments of the Kazurai."
	"3001808706"	"Compliments of the Kazurai. Loser..."
	"575990483"	"Your fighting style is weak."
	"1431558725"	"The Kazurai will not be denied."
	"128069922"	"Greetings from the Kazurai."
	"1889862068"	"You were kinda asking for it."
	"561622637"	"Fledglings don't belong in this fight."
	"3094413271"	"Quit your warbling."
	"122835119"	"Got ya."
	"2656764181"	"You're done."
	"3915133315"	"That's it."
	"2000200736"	"Boom!"
	"4166838"	"Nice try, pal."
	"2570503436"	"Yer dead."
	"3996251546"	"So long."
	"2123294731"	"Just like that."
	"160028829"	"Nice knowin' ya."
	"1766740344"	"See ya, stupid."
	"508125678"	"For the Kazurai!"
	"2269130836"	"Lights out, pal."
	"3604111468"	"Hey, hold this."
	"1339765206"	"Got a second?"
	"953942336"	"Hey, you."
	"2797114595"	"Beak throw!"
	"3518997621"	"Feather dart!"
	"1219950031"	"Fly!"
	"1068615001"	"Ah ha!"
	"2936985800"	"Little Kunai kiss..."
	"3624527966"	"Ha ha"
	"3100533179"	"Ha ha!"
	"576667277"	"Aggh."
	"3427884961"	"Missed."
	"1379256834"	"Mm, close."
	"624097940"	"Nope."
	"3663281173"	"Get over here."
	"1129344431"	"Yeah, you."
	"878140729"	"Got a minute?"
	"2855520410"	"I need you over here."
	"3711236108"	"Hey, get over here."
	"1144891830"	"Come here!"
	"859478304"	"Come here, you..."
	"957456195"	"I'll take that."
	"2685980409"	"That one's mine."
	"1232825292"	"Hand it over, pal."
	"1048337242"	"Gimme that."
	"2809465568"	"Yup, I'll take that."
	"3497146998"	"Skill pays off."
	"1087186919"	"Pappa needs a new suet ball."
	"935991153"	"Cash for the Kazurai."
	"1460510356"	"Ding ding ding"
	"65963490"	"Every little bit."
	"1961473396"	"For the cause."
	"3990938830"	"I dunno. Blame the shoppie."
	"2598884440"	"He coulda just walked on by."
	"75710971"	"Shoulda stayed in your racks."
	"1938059629"	"Geez. What'd I ever do to you before I killed you?"
	"3935117527"	"You're done."
	"2643071041"	"Get outta here, creep."
	"221580752"	"Don't worry, I'll make it count."
	"2050112838"	"Pecked for a penny."
	"537570818"	"I will take that."
	"452310179"	"Killing creeps is kind of a moral grey area."
	"1844610101"	"I love that sound."
	"4110144911"	"Ooh, a nest egg."
	"2214389017"	"Got my nest egg."
	"496529594"	"Wet my beak a little."
	"1788821548"	"Bawk bawk, baby!"
	"4086698390"	"This beak pays the bills."
	"2224103680"	"A little something for the plumage."
	"338574481"	"Well, feak my beak!"
	"1663634439"	"Clutch move!"
	"3104047032"	"Fly into my pocket."
	"836298592"	"I'd do this for free, but not if you're payin."
	"1189074934"	"Oooh, shiny."
	"3456421678"	"Mooore money."
	"1348491917"	"Money money."
	"661088795"	"This hero stuff's starting to pay off."
	"3371976720"	"I'm saving for a hawk house."
	"1375017386"	"Just a tidbit."
	"653404476"	"Lil' nugget."
	"3096886431"	"It's a morsel."
	"3482422281"	"I can hawk it for something."
	"3239368525"	"Urgh"
	"1478330103"	"Last hit!"
	"790279777"	"Worth it."
	"2977833922"	"Money money money."
	"3329823572"	"That feels... a bit better."
	"1601192686"	"Still in pain, but... nice."
	"2288181391"	"Ha ha"
	"369521964"	"Ha ha ha"
	"4161278976"	"Ha ha ha ha ha"
	"1756826001"	"Ah ha ha ha ha ha!"
	"531642631"	"Oh ho ho ho ho ha ha ha"
	"2138550498"	"Ah ha ha ha! Ahh"
	"141590644"	"Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha haa"
	"2440679886"	"Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ah ha ha ha ha ha"
	"3867074904"	"Pff ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ha ha ha woo"
	"2014999803"	"Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ah ah ha ha ha ha!"
	"253576301"	"Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha aha ha ha!"
	"1549269139"	"I like the feel of this."
	"742198300"	"They'd better look out now."
	"1530543242"	"Yeah, I work out."
	"1162660306"	"Do I look taller?"
	"3695548520"	"This rules."
	"2873272574"	"Awesome..."
	"1109462475"	"And I thought I was great before."
	"3676855409"	"All this and good looks too."
	"1268204000"	"Now you're all in trouble."
	"426158727"	"Bring on some bigger challenges."
	"4150840235"	"Check out these new muscles."
	"2154822461"	"Gettin' stronger."
	"4026863538"	"Oh yeah, ramping up."
	"2265071396"	"I just get better and better."
	"398271157"	"Man, I feel good."
	"1622807075"	"Let's take things up a notch."
	"8231878"	"Can't stop me now."
	"4000578282"	"Oh yeah, I rule."
	"2574568060"	"And ? now I'm awesome."
	"118513631"	"Yeah, I'm into self-improvement."
	"3911073523"	"All this and good looks too."
	"2652442213"	"This could go to a guy's head."
	"245765108"	"Oh yeah, who's the man?"
	"2040603490"	"Now you're all in trouble."
	"4034290816"	"The Flightless need me."
	"1769944378"	"I'll honor the cause of the Kazurai."
	"511182252"	"I think Kraw would approve."
	"2149355535"	"Precision is a pursuit, not an accomplishment."
	"4145782937"	"The only way out of this is: smash right through."
	"1846735139"	"It's time."
	"420856245"	"This is how we win this thing."
	"2309676068"	"I'm ready."
	"4272811186"	"One step at a time."
	"2657772887"	"You have to fight to improve."
	"3916256705"	"Power doesn't come without a price."
	"1885602939"	"Now I just need the wisdom to use it."
	"123942125"	"Call it. They're done."
	"2567414094"	"Pick a blade, it'll do."
	"3993014744"	"I could do this with a butter knife."
	"3470127484"	"Losing's just part of the game."
	"1474076870"	"We'll get 'em next time."
	"551260240"	"Use it. This'll make use stronger."
	"3200189939"	"This is just gonna make us better."
	"3384292709"	"Don't even worry about it. Just practice for the big win."
	"1353802975"	"Keep trying, we'll win next time."
	"666260553"	"Failure is not the end."
	"3070839256"	"Nobody wins all the time."
	"188826502"	"Mine! My lotus!"
	"2454196796"	"Free pond food."
	"3847168682"	"Are these free? Can I just take these?"
	"1282337978"	"Top is missing!"
	"3580345600"	"Middle's missing!"
	"2724236694"	"Bottom is missing!"
	"3219494777"	"Look, I'm never gonna be the bird I was ten years ago."
	"653051587"	"But I don't have to be the bird I was ten weeks ago either."
	"1374418517"	"We took back Skywrath by working together."
	"3482280950"	"Whatever the future holds... We'll find that together too."
	"3095941984"	"Who knows. Maybe we'll even get into some trouble along the way."
	"562103002"	"I'd like that."
	"1859691511"	"I gotta hand it to Bakeet."
	"4157731405"	"That's a bird wise beyond his own understanding."
	"2161558235"	"When he found me in Icewrack, I wasn't a hero. I was just a broken shell."
	"515004280"	"I learned all the wrong lessons from losing some really great people in some really awful fights."
	"1773496302"	"But talking to him... It really grounded me."
	"4038866516"	"Helped me remember who I was before all this started."
	"2277181122"	"And why I even wanted to get involved in this fight."
	"386145107"	"Imperia was a threat we needed to deal with."
	"1610820549"	"And unlike a lotta folks, I could actually do something to help."
	"12886560"	"No one said it'd be easy. Or we wouldn't lose any friends along the way."
	"2009305782"	"We all lost something. But we won something too. And I have to believe...it was worth it."
	"4006265612"	"There's no magic wand to fix everything Imperia ruined in Skywrath."
	"2580411290"	"There's a whole city full of people who still need some help."
	"128542265"	"But we can find a way to do that too."
	"1890473647"	"The battle for Skywrath might be over."
	"3920037653"	"But the work to rebuild it -- better, and for everyone -- well, that's just begun."
	"3068774533"	"I never wanted to lead the Kazurai. All I ever wanted was Imperia gone."
	"803248447"	"That's all my army wanted too. They wanted me to train them so they could help."
	"1491577257"	"So we trained. And we trained. And we got good. And we started to think we might win."
	"3330489354"	"Word got out. More volunteered."
	"2978221212"	"I got a lot of them killed. A bunch of kids who just wanted to help make things better."
	"680353062"	"I put my swords away. And I haven't drawn them since."
	"1602907568"	"So if I'm going to break my vow... it might as well be in a battle for the fate of the world, right?"
	"725545020"	"All I've ever wanted, all I've ever trained for, is getting Imperia off the throne."
	"2989990278"	"Kraw and I threw everything we had at her. We were so sure it would be enough."
	"3308294416"	"We took a bunch of kids from the gutters and we trained up an army."
	"1532232883"	"And she slaughtered them. She broke us to pieces and she laughed."
	"743650341"	"Too much blood. I put my swords away. Exiled myself in Icewrack. I didn't want to worry about anyone dying but me."
	"3042600351"	"And now here I am in a battle of the Ancients. The fate of the world in the balance. The stakes couldn't be higher."
	"3260896521"	"But I don't have to worry about anyone dying because of me. I can just get to work."
	"2474809177"	"I was born with a price on my head."
	"176932579"	"As I got better at causing trouble, that price went up."
	"2106390133"	"Every time Imperia raised the bounty, I knew I must have done something right."
	"3823657942"	"I think that's the worst part of being gone so long in Icewrack."
	"2498712384"	"I've got to get that price back up to a respectable number."
	"2167879863"	"I've seen our Queen order the deaths of people she'll even never meet."
	"406743309"	"And I've seen flightless, hatched and raised in the gutters, fight to their last breath."
	"1866029467"	"It isn't about the power you're born with."
	"4049456184"	"It's how much you're willing to fight for the power you don't have."
	"965435346"	"A few years ago I was just a flightless bird."
	"2692877928"	"Then I was a flightless bird leading a resistance against an evil queen."
	"3615833854"	"And now... somehow... I'm a flightless bird fighting gods."
	"1239526237"	"Well. Good thing I brought my swords."
	"837883931"	"Maybe Shen'll be a better queen than Imperia. Maybe she won't. "
	"2834844065"	"Maybe the trick to being a good ruler is you should be the last person in the world who wants to do it."
	"3758061879"	"Either way, if Skywrath needs to depose another queen, they can call on the Kazurai."
	"1100737684"	"We've got a regicide under our belt now. We're getting pretty good at it."
	"2303557502"	"We fought before and we lost everything."
	"272903876"	"That gives me the advantage now. Because now I have nothing to lose. I?m not afraid to die."
	"1732451922"	"I've been dead this whole time. Living with the ghosts of the men who died alongside me. "
	"4180118513"	"And so is Imperia. She just doesn?t know it yet."
	"2616774800"	"I fought. I lost. The end. Or so I thought."
	"49381674"	"But then Bakeet and Shen came and found me in Icewrack."
	"1979101628"	"And together we somehow managed to beat a dragon."
	"3952223263"	"So maybe the fight wasn't over after all."
	"2627015817"	"Maybe I was just waiting for reinforcements."
	"591706101"	"I hung up my swords because I knew I wasn't the man the Kazurai needed."
	"3125667407"	"I thought it was too much. Too much sorrow. Too much futility."
	"3444233945"	"And it was too much. That man couldn't handle it. "
	"1395540858"	"So that man, I buried up in Icewrack with that dragon."
	"606696428"	"Imperia has no idea the man who's coming for her now."
	"2688710072"	"On it."
	"961225730"	"You got it."
	"1313608852"	"Your call."
	"3492315447"	"Your funeral."
	"3107530201"	"Your funeral. Wait, no, my funeral."
	"2804920737"	"I was thinking the same thing."
	"1042735131"	"Good idea."
	"1226952845"	"Yep."
	"3651063068"	"Sounds like a plan."
	"2929327498"	"I was thinking the exact same thing."
	"3462296687"	"Not a bad idea."
	"689503644"	"There? Yeah there."
	"1579142410"	"Better than here."
	"3340147888"	"Flyin'"
	"1666079100"	"Flyin'"
	"2953948198"	"Spikes diggin'"
	"779434373"	"Talk's cheap."
	"1500645651"	"Burbin'"
	"3229309097"	"What's the word?"
	"3078383679"	"I trust my sources."
	"667121070"	"Wait for my signal."
	"1355040056"	"Less yappin', more flappin'"
	"3109635321"	"What, just here? Sure."
	"805555421"	"Better check it out."
	"1191509067"	"It piques the beak."
	"3725438449"	"Where's this trail go?"
	"2836045159"	"Every path's a journey, is what Kraw says."
	"929958084"	"All for it."
	"1080637522"	"I'll poke my beak in."
	"3646974440"	"Flock to it."
	"2926008702"	"I'm the migratory kind."
	"1054360815"	"I'm feeling a bit peckish."
	"1239381113"	"Flow of the fight."
	"542119235"	"Right here, right? Got it."
	"456040222"	"I think I see something."

	"2717737707"	"It'll take more than that to kill me."
	"3606729341"	"Vengeance will guide these blades."

	"2794497778"	"I'm back!"
	"1773382770"	"Coil your stupid clouds around THAT, dummy."
	"4038786504"	"Abaddon, you are Abba-DONE."
	"2277363038"	"I just turned two idiots into two dead idiots. Wait, am I an alchemist?"
	"433674493"	"Bet you don't have a potion to cure THAT."
	"2161117511"	"There. You're a ghost. Now you're a much NEWER apparition."
	"275715286"	"You know, the funny thing is I've been to Turstarkuri? They all look like this guy. It's just nothing but arm days there."
	"4120327650"	"So would an 'anti'-Antimage just be a mage? Or does it just generally mean anyone who hates you?"
	"1734878272"	"No need to thank me. I do this for mage children."
	"128953765"	"Your goldfish are missing."
	"1890098483"	"Fragment of the Mad Moon, huh? Hrgh. Wonder how you got the job."
	"3919694985"	"You are without a doubt the biggest, reddest, loudest, most basically nude hero I've killed so far."
	"2661743647"	"You know the best thing about big red idiots that yell all the time? Getting to make them stop."
	"12741052"	"Brain Sap. Enfeeble. You turn everybody into a weak idiot. Like you."
	"2009422122"	"Hey, look. I've overcome my fear of killing you."
	"4006348944"	"Nightmare of the gods, huh? Why don't you try that crap on someone who isn't asleep?"
	"158606743"	"Batrider, huh? So why do they call you that?"
	"2121471233"	"Batrider. I got a better name for you: Dead guy on a bat."
	"1535495920"	"Birds are beasts. When's the mastery supposed to start?"
	"3263995722"	"Bloodseeker, huh? Whelp, see ya later."
	"2973392212"	"You live on a planet where everybody is filled with blood. We're all sloshing around with it. Your job's not hard."
	"3045830620"	"More like blood leaker, am I right?"
	"1482088835"	"Well, you found the blood. And it was inside you all along."
	"737098367"	"The things you'll do for money. Like get killed."
	"3001445317"	"I'll pour one out for you."
	"576288340"	"So that snot just, uh... pours out of you when you die. Ugh."
	"1432241858"	"You died like you lived: leaking snot."
	"899272487"	"I HATE spiders."
	"1117716401"	"Is it arachnophobia when the spiders are the size of a house? Isn't that just common sense?"
	"3684150795"	"Half horse. Half human. All dead."
	"2895158941"	"That big horseshoe to your chest for luck didn't really work out luckwise."
	"1173568424"	"Chance of you being dead? 100 percent."
	"3707398674"	"Chen. Everyone told me about you. You're the one no one likes."
	"994199317"	"All you eternal life guys die surprisingly easy."
	"1279620995"	"Take that Lich! No wait, which skeleton are you again?"
	"2060999136"	"Ah, there's your 'off' switch."
	"2497067212"	"Oh my god I thought you'd never shut up."
	"3822127194"	"Enjoy the silence, everyone."
	"2109054457"	"Armed only with his intellect? I think I found your mistake."
	"2478570709"	"I just wanna put you in my pocket and crush your tiny dead body."
	"3837578307"	"Aren't you just too cute to live."
	"1673750689"	"Looks like sundown, Dawnbreaker."
	"2379024781"	"Woof. That guy's makeup's a mess."
	"4207556891"	"Dazzle - truly a word that strikes fear into literally no one."
	"1689169080"	"Did you see that coming, Death Prophet?"
	"2325794196"	"So your power is summoning fences, huh? They really do let anyone fight in this thing."
	"4255644930"	"Your army of spectral fences could not save you."
	"1830346899"	"Doombringer, huh? So why do they call you that?"
	"1031256722"	"Uh oh. Guess who brought on their own doom?"
	"438292485"	"I'm sure you'll bring some doom next time, pal."
	"1223572322"	"I don't have anything clever to say. I'm genuinely happy you're dead."
	"1072237556"	"So, you can turn from a guy... into a dragon... into a dead guy."
	"2799721038"	"Somebody should notify your parents - oh riiiight."
	"3521604312"	"Luckily you're an orphan, so nobody's gonna miss you."
	"2916501315"	"Your big move is arrows made of ice, huh? Haha, well I hope the weather doesn't get slightly warm."
	"1334050683"	"Return, Earth Spirit, to the Great... Patch of Dirt in the Sky."
	"2710412887"	"I guess this is the day you return to dust, eh?"
	"3599412929"	"You really did shake the earth, falling dead on your ass like that."
	"1177924432"	"They should NOT let really old people fight in this thing."
	"1375013411"	"Warrior-Poet, huh? Well, you definitely fought like a poet."
	"653408949"	"Here's a poem for ya: hey idiot, you're dead. It's the non-rhyming kind."
	"3220925199"	"Your army of mind-slaves is now free. Even for us, you were a bad person."
	"1452854842"	"I guess no one will ever solve the riddle of why you sucked at fighting."
	"3096882966"	"Faceless... lifeless... Basically the same thing."
	"3482427264"	"You're not FACELESS. You've got a mouth, chin, a basic face structure. That's a lot of work to hide the fact that you just can't smell."
	"1596883473"	"Looks like you had a brush with death. No, wait. You HAVE a brush. And death."
	"2708088442"	"Flying's not so great now, is it?"
	"946042816"	"Small, but tough. I respect that. Well, respected. Until I was able to kill you incredibly easily."
	"1057928153"	"Of all the balls of light I've ever killed, you were my favorite. To kill."
	"3635846878"	"Wielder of the four elements: Quas! Wex! Exort! Losing!"
	"3480627117"	"Well, you can't make a dragon-freak omelette without breaking a two-headed egg."
	"1451193879"	"When a master swordsman slays another, he must sing the song of death to his sword. So I better learn it in case I ever meet one."
	"3357270964"	"An island of the best swordsmen on Earth sinks into the ocean. You're the ONLY one to survive. And you're THAT easy to beat at swords?"
	"3206337314"	"Jugger not good at swords."
	"638943896"	"Lights out, pal."
	"3249385375"	"What do they give you if you kill a fast food mascot? A tour of the kitchen? Free fish sticks for life?"
	"3064635145"	"How did you celebrate National Kill a Pirate Day, Kestrel? Funny story."
	"527890131"	"You fought with honor and heart today, cobra commander."
	"1752286789"	"It's just like that famous legion story 300, except there's only one of you and you're super easy to kill."
	"4128592870"	"If I hadn't killed you, that skin condition of yours would have."
	"107857810"	"You came all the way from Hell just to get killed by a bird."
	"3898844862"	"Sorry to kill you. I know your life was rough, friendless tree wizard."
	"4010697383"	"I'll tell your family you've gone to live on a farm up north."
	"2550747697"	"Roll over. Play dead."
	"146165664"	"That is one ugly horse."
	"3276731773"	"You shoulda been god of something else, 'cause you kinda suck at war."
	"707612744"	"Be honest, did you LET me kill you because you felt too ugly to carry on?"
	"878421264"	"Monkey see, monkey don't."
	"3663053884"	"I see you morphed into a dead body. Super realistic, too."
	"859201801"	"You, uh... you know Muerta means dead, right?"
	"1144082847"	"Gone too soon. I will truly miss killing you."
	"3711434789"	"Like the sirens of legend, you lured me straight to your death."
	"1300700596"	"You have fallen, Nature's Prophet. Or should I call you by your true name: Nature's Valley Organic Chicken."
	"2065314775"	"You're the disease. I'm the cure."
	"2457442018"	"Why don't you boys have a rest?"
	"3850282612"	"So long, ugly idiots."
	"352727552"	"I had this dream I killed a weak fancy guy. Maybe I should be an oracle!"
	"1701627535"	"You used that sword real pretty-like. Too bad you weren't actually GOOD."
	"309065241"	"All the sword training in the world's useless in a good old fashioned scrap, fancy boy."
	"2338498467"	"You're a terrible assassin, but you make a good ghost."
	"467515954"	"It's not an illusion. You're actually dead."
	"1043030467"	"Stop givin' us birds a bad name."
	"3611870454"	"I eat bugs like you for breakfast. Literally."
	"821094897"	"You're the only thing I've ever killed that actually smells better when it's dead."
	"1345806356"	"So long, you pugly thing."
	"3191406904"	"I'll give you this. You're pretty good at being in pain."
	"1592584230"	"I know a magician never reveals his secrets, but how'd you die so easy?"
	"703322288"	"Goodbye, Grand Mag-us. Magus? May-gus? I guess it doesn't matter at this point."
	"3648320745"	"Hah! You WISH you could shut me up!"
	"2926822527"	"Silent but deadly - that's how you'll be remembered. No, I'm thinking of a fart."
	"3467922842"	"Taste ground, feather boy."
	"3115547916"	"You're grounded!"
	"549072054"	"Well aren't you just a flappy little guy? Just flappin' around with those big fat stupid wings?"
	"1472011296"	"Why don't you fly back to Loser Heaven?"
	"3386476931"	"Look at those big, stupid... lustrous, feather-filled wings of yours."
	"3202267413"	"Your heart wouldn't have stopped if it hadn't been pumping all that blood to those big wings of yours. Those things are basically blood sacks."
	"3228550568"	"Tough luck, Dark Anchovy."
	"489703562"	"As a general rule, I refuse to kill little old ladies. Unless they try to kill me first. So this is okay. What I've done here today... is ethically fine."
	"4080937382"	"It's pretty sad you had an actual gun and still couldn't win this fight."
	"2218334512"	"Not sure if you can hear me down there in Hell, but you missed your shot."
	"4099141055"	"Oh crap, I killed somebody's sad monkey-cow."
	"2203376937"	"It was an honor to fight you, proud monkey-cow."
	"69958091"	"Now that you're dead, I'll just take your huge sword. Nnnnnf! I'll just leave that huge sword there."
	"54967762"	"You can't spell assassin without ass. And you were ass out there."
	"3980975358"	"Your best illusion was the illusion you were under that you could beat me."
	"788933128"	"You are, without a doubt, one of the stupidest looking things I've ever seen in my life. And this is a talking bird with a sword saying this, so really let this in."
	"3238546212"	"Good news. You won't have to lug all that crap on your back in the afterlife."
	"678161937"	"The bigger they come, the deader they fall."
	"2976038827"	"I hope you find your entwife someday. Or... anyone tree-based, I guess. I'm honestly not even sure why I'm thinking about this."
	"568173114"	"So... Why do they call you Troll Warlord?"
	"907877193"	"So how come they call you Tusk?"
	"1092234207"	"That is a LOT of ivory. I wonder what I could get for those things in Cladd."
	"3625155173"	"Well, now you're six feet underlord."
	"829480784"	"Undying, huh? That is... false advertising."
	"1182265286"	"So I'm clear, is this... UN-undying?"
	"952537979"	"So what are you supposed to be? Some kind of spirit? Of revenge? Can you hear me?"
	"2538794146"	"You were just a big flappin' sock full of poison, werent you."
	"3763723316"	"Nice boots. That's what I'm going to make out of you."
	"2117159319"	"Ugh. See ya in my nightmares, you freakshow."
	"2005337532"	"Void Spirit. I guess Purple Santa was taken."
	"1615314127"	"Looks like you win. At dying first. I assume that's the game you were playing, 'cause you died FAST."
	"2387205603"	"Squashed you like a...well, like a whatever you are."
	"4263717228"	"I can't believe that whole reading books superpower didn't help you out here."
	"1855730941"	"I'm a bit of a bibliophile myself. Have you ever read I Just Kicked Your Ass? It's really good, I think you'd relate to a lot of what's in it. It's seven hundred pages of me kicking your ass."
	"3529752246"	"You're dead, Wraith King. Or should I call you by your original name: Jeff Skeleton."
	"1275538197"	"Father of the gods? Man, your god kids must be so disappointed in you."
	"2662501366"	"Courtesy of the flightless, your majesty."
	"3921001312"	"That was for the Kazurai."
	"2078092373"	"That was for the Kazurai."
	"1891429082"	"The queen is dead... Good."
	"129751628"	"Skywrath is free of you."
	"2581549039"	"I waited my whole life for that."
	"928293100"	"No, no, no."
	"1079218298"	"Take your best shot."
	"3646603712"	"Block party."
	"2925392214"	"This bird don't duck."
	"809067765"	"You're parry welcome."
	"1195267171"	"Bring it on, buddy!"
	"2142487750"	"Would you shut up!"
	"146076752"	"Quit yer squawkin."
	"2445125098"	"The silence of sai."
	"3870987644"	"Not a chirp."
	"4116275955"	"Not. a. chirp."
	"2027815135"	"Sai Toss!"
	"265891913"	"Why don't you shut up?"
	"2530238963"	"Flick of the wrist."
	"458621218"	"Check out my scepter!"
	"2187284632"	"Now this is a sweet scepter."
	"4116209678"	"Bow to the bird king! heh heh"
	"561773120"	"Welcome aboard, shadow me."
	"3480591212"	"Get 'em, shadow me!"
	"1360072399"	"Evil shadow twin!"
	"638991961"	"Let's get 'em!"
	"3206508515"	"Go get 'em, us!"
	"799044210"	"Get 'em, evil me!"
	"1332214679"	"Now you gotta kill two birds!"
	"945867521"	"Now you gotta kill two birds! Got a stone?"
	"2708052667"	"Yeah, it's a whole flock now."
	"4194008528"	"This is flocking ridiculous."
	"1208631182"	"Bird twin powers, activate!"
	"1057820440"	"Who's who what's what up is down!"
	"1171164497"	"Lost me!"
	"280992415"	"Did ya lose me?"
	"852082119"	"Can't pluck what you can't see."
	"2881547389"	"Take a gander."
	"3704085739"	"Where'd I go?"
	"1117997384"	"Cut and run!"
	"899971550"	"Nooope."

	"832363681"	"Ready to go."
	"1184623671"	"Let's do this thing."
	"3640621460"	"Beak? Check. Talons? Check."
	"2952284418"	"Just point me at 'em."
	"1106651182"	"I'm Kestrel. Friends call me Kez."
	"3511236031"	"Do my wings work? For the answer, look skyward, while I stab you in the belly."
	"2790130985"	"Let's go to work!"
	"3330903244"	"Flightless Fury. That's what they call me."
	"2978921562"	"Let's go, let's go, let's go."
	"679996896"	"Alright. Time to unfurl the wings. The ol'flappers. The big guns. Ha ha ha, they don't do anything."

	"3252963541"	"Ok. LGS. Let's get stabbin'."
	"3068360771"	"Grounded, right? Let's all stay on the ground."
	"803875321"	"I arrive on a wing and a prayer and no wings and I haven't got a prayer."
	"1491933551"	"I'm just gonna wing it."
	"3360818430"	"My sword, my beak, and myself: three sharpest things in this forest."
	"3210032232"	"I fly into battle! Figuratively."
	"3987005199"	"The eyes of an eagle. The heart of a dragon. And the wings of a... penguin."
	"3588389214"	"You have my swords."
	"1290479844"	"My swords are ready."
	"1005328498"	"You have my blades."

	"2311592459"	"My swords are hungry."
	"4274989725"	"No one escapes."
	"1741060903"	"No survivors, no mercy."
	"281103281"	"Time to unleash hell."
	"2393234962"	"Let's make 'em remember this one."
	"4188204676"	"For the Kazurai..."

	"463067"	"Thanks a lot."
	"1996496973"	"Thanks."
	"3162610912"	"You guys said that would work."
	"629722458"	"Why did it focus on me?!"
	"1385168332"	"It's a tormentor. How did you think that was gonna go?"
	"2021817446"	"Good job gang. That barely even hurt."
	"3783994844"	"Free Aghanim Shard? Can't complain about that."
	"2525764938"	"What do you think would happen if we cut the chains?"
	"1497204786"	"Let's fire this up."

	"1519036153"	"Sorry. I was just thinking about something else."

	"608118614"	"What the flock."
	"1396185024"	"I don't PLAN these things. It always just goes like this."
