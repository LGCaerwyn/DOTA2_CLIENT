"
	"3204206141"	"Your graphics card falls below our official minimum specs,
which have not been changed in the transition to Dota 2 Reborn.
When running under the Source 1 engine, that did not prevent
the game from working because the engine was not designed around
the full capabilities of the minimum spec for graphic cards.
However, Dota 2 Reborn relies on graphics features such as vertex textures and shader model 3.0
and so adherence to the minimum spec is a stronger requirement
than it was in Source 1 Dota 2. Unfortunately this means that Dota 2 Reborn
will not be able to run on some graphics cards from 2006 or before.

	"1145697331"	"You sip at the cup of power. I have no need."
	"3296263682"	"Even I know when to stop swinging, Abaddon."
	"2856817951"	"There's no honor in killing the little one, but I'll enjoy it all the same."
	"874709180"	"Stimulants are nothing to a god's strength!"
	"1126445098"	"It always feels good to kill an ancient one."
	"3660407184"	"Ah, that feels nice. I'd worked up a sweat!"
	"2905231622"	"A coward meets his fate!"
	"1033194647"	"The only fun in fighting you was when you died."
	"1251113985"	"You didn't need to go through all the trouble"
	"710276580"	"Don't worry, Zett. I'll bring them all crashing down."
	"1565705586"	"You lack none of the brutality of war and you still had no chance."
	"3294336200"	"Haha! That was fun, but the outcome was predictable!"
	"3009193054"	"My nightmares evacuate bigger than you!"
	"758657533"	"This is where mortal bravery leads."
	"1514078571"	"Master of nothing!"
	"3275116753"	"Even the beasts will prostrate themselves before me!"
	"3023134791"	"You caught the wrong scent, Bloodseeker."
	"613318102"	"What I'll do to you is nothing to what I have in store for your masters!"
	"1401507136"	"The mourners will be fresh with drink!"
	"24684071"	"I never heard any toasts in my name!"
	"1988073137"	"Stand or flee, it makes no difference!"
	"4017538827"	"These quills have a nice tingle to them!"
	"2557605789"	"Now to harvest the eggs!"
	"102064702"	"You're gonna look real funny with no legs, Arachnia. Just to let you know."
	"1897026216"	"Know your place, Centaur!"
	"3894084370"	"Your old arena title means nothing."
	"2669425540"	"The order of my ranks withstands the chaos charge!"
	"262352405"	"Gods forge order from the chaos!"
	"2024021635"	"No matter how many creatures you enslave, you die alone, you weak-willed fool."
	"701582425"	"Problem solved! You should have come to me sooner."
	"1868867568"	"Just remember, I didn't break your spine. Your own armor did that."
	"4134401610"	"If you can't fight skin bared, you can't fight at all!"
	"2171258588"	"Are you sure you're in the right place?"
	"521032575"	"If it's on the battlefield, I kill it!"
	"1745445865"	"Sharpest point wins!"
	"4043321939"	"Your strategy played right into my strategy!"
	"3020322016"	"I used to pluck the wings from faeries as a boy. I thought I was past that!"
	"381165396"	"Vex me no more!"
	"1639919554"	"Respectable, but I've seen many last longer."
	"2616299593"	"Secrets of Dezun? Please. I've seen things you priests wouldn't believe."
	"539308343"	"I warned you to keep your mouth shut around me!"
	"3106693261"	"Your powers hold no sway over the gods, crone!"
	"3458945051"	"Sparkle hard, little guy! Haha!"
	"1347405240"	"I hate lightning!"
	"659092782"	"A true warrior doesn't need a dramatic name."
	"3191973012"	"There, I've cured you of your God envy."
	"3376845826"	"Hahaha, now that's a shield bash!"
	"1509525907"	"Dragons make a fine mount, but you don't have the temperment."
	"788445445"	"Ugh, you horrid creature. I've done the world a favor!"
	"1312370912"	"Your puny wind just makes my cape blow even more attractively."
	"960364662"	"Boulder smash!"
	"2687979980"	"Well, that was easy enough. Can cross you off the list."
	"3610272090"	"Your mind is like porridge. How could you have won?"
	"703803054"	"I decide who trembles."
	"1045677167"	"Oh, something about that felt extra nice."
	"2807731669"	"Alright...Kill titan? Check!"
	"3495798083"	"Sometimes it's just fun to destroy a truly rare specimen."
	"1088600274"	"Flame...out."
	"937789508"	"Aw, damn. This one's not even gold!"
	"1695834915"	"Stoke the fire and carve a spit!"
	"303256501"	"You've lost a step, grandpa."
	"2333737487"	"I'll poke two holes here so you can see the river Styx."
	"4229771929"	"I had time enough to dispatch YOU."
	"1652139834"	"You leave nothing of worth behind."
	"360617900"	"Give my regards to your masters!"
	"2356659734"	"Hahaha, the Nothl Realm! I've seen bigger latrines!"
	"4218484352"	"So eager to die?"
	"612756422"	"Get good, youngin."
	"482925447"	"I don't need all that fancy crap to kick your ass!"
	"2081378914"	"Why has it come to this?!"
	"185098996"	"Come to your senses! This behavior leads only to ruin!"
	"2449552206"	"Now my uncle's collection is complete."
	"3842376664"	"Your bladework was unoriginal."
	"2070058619"	"Your brilliance ends in darkness, old man. Just like all the rest..."
	"207988461"	"All who came before me must perish!"
	"2506946391"	"Drown on your tears, you salty mess."
	"3798714305"	"How many times do you need to die before you learn your lesson?"
	"1926552144"	"You should have chosen literally anyone else."
	"97774278"	"And I heard you were such a great commander. Hahah!"
	"4220997293"	"Hard to bite down with a spear in your gullet!"
	"2358279739"	"You should thank me, creature. This death brings honor to one I suspect has none!"
	"362360705"	"At least you already know the way!"
	"1654529815"	"A single augmentation can't make up for the paltry sum of your parts."
	"4244277940"	"Your mistress is next."
	"2348661282"	"There's no pleasure in the killing of sheep."
	"318040984"	"Shift your way out of that!"
	"1710480142"	"The question now becomes... Shall I skin you for a rug?"
	"4115449503"	"This is the ugliest damn unicorn I've ever killed."
	"2186016265"	"The horn doesn't look that valuable to me... But maybe for drinking!"
	"3800858604"	"Poor little princess. Poised to the last...for naught."
	"2508935034"	"You chose the wrong god, princess."
	"209854144"	"I'll have to embellish your death when I tell this story..."
	"2072325718"	"It's hard to believe it took this long for someone to kill you."
	"3856776181"	"Consider your life sated."
	"2464582499"	"Sing your song for my uncle. See if he cares!"
	"200268505"	"Ugh, that almost felt like...work!"
	"2095639119"	"This spear cures all ailments!"
	"3965188062"	"Aren't you beautiful? I'll mount your head above the mantle!"
	"2605762376"	"How about I just kill one head, Ogre?"
	"1402383541"	"You were brain dead already."
	"613522467"	"Oops. I thought you'd surrender when things got tough."
	"3180907929"	"I had no quarrel with your worthless god...only with you!"
	"3399482639"	"I'll keep your tongue as a talisman for a time!"
	"1425762476"	"Mortal royalty should thank me!"
	"603740218"	"You're just a glorified guard dog."
	"3136620928"	"You die as you lived, like a fool."
	"3455203606"	"There's no grace in this death, assassin."
	"2463041087"	"Any of you left standing?"
	"709497873"	"Your flesh will rest upon this field for all of time, a monument to my victory!"
	"1250794996"	"Your corpse will be lasting monument to my greatness!"
	"1032498530"	"The help shouldn't lift a hand against their betters."
	"2760113368"	"Did you take me for mortal, whipping boy?"
	"3785881908"	"At least you tried to steal from the best."
	"1306548717"	"Not so grand after all!"
	"988244347"	"I abandon you to a desert of the forgotten!"
	"2750298305"	"Let that be a message to all deserters!"
	"3572041815"	"Where'd you learn how to use a trident?"
	"1146492358"	"Just like spearfishing! Ahahaha!"
	"860955984"	"My spear will never rust!"
	"1637928503"	"Slippery little bastard!"
	"380108449"	"I'll use your guts as bait for a bigger fish."
	"2410589979"	"Oh, I'm sorry. Were you in the middle of something?"
	"4171865997"	"Shame to kill such an interesting beast. At least it was fun."
	"1724713518"	"If only you'd bent to my will... Oh well. I may keep the ring."
	"298465976"	"Each one of your kin will die by my hand!"
	"2294508290"	"I thought I could use you. I was wrong."
	"4291058580"	"God's strength! Hmmm..."
	"1870349829"	"Your past accomplishments mean nothing, and your future is at an end."
	"410810003"	"Bedtime stories for demons don't scare me."
	"2025586550"	"Even the one you serve serves another."
	"264032224"	"Not today, pollywog."
	"2528484954"	"Normally I wouldn't trouble myself with the touched..."
	"3786583756"	"Best to melt this down before someone else gets any bright ideas."
	"2144746351"	"Crushing rocks is a baby's game!"
	"147917817"	"You'll make a fine whetstone for my spear."
	"2446875203"	"Heavy timber falls with ease!"
	"3873401557"	"Fear not, I shall build something grand with you!"
	"1986033476"	"Your meaningless fights sully the name of war!"
	"23545810"	"This is where your limitations begin, and you end."
	"939157937"	"They say you commanded armies. Did others fight in your place?"
	"1090345255"	"There is nothing that I cannot kill!"
	"3656648861"	"The dirge is a nice tune, but you can't carry it for a damn."
	"2935175179"	"Time for a new pair of boots!"
	"815246760"	"You're a mere decoration compared to me!"
	"1200659774"	"Your Ozkvosh isn't even passable!"
	"3734621316"	"What did you think was going to happen, bookworm?"
	"2845768722"	"Write a poem about it in the afterlife."
	"958521731"	"It'll take more than chants and charms, you imbecile."
	"1311166741"	"I know a thing or two about hubris, and you had this coming!"
	"786520304"	"I'll scatter your bones from here to the pits of hell!"
	"1508272230"	"This isn't your pantheon anymore, old man."
	"3236903388"	"I've been waiting a long time for this!"
	"3085437258"	"I thought that would be much more satisfying..."
	"697081065"	"You're just as pathetic a mortal as you were a god..."
	"1586211967"	"Mother will be pleased!"
	"2823115154"	"Mother will be pleased!"
	"3347250629"	"I didn't come here to exchange pleasantries. It's time for you to die!"
	"2961558867"	"You should have offered me a cookie!"
	"540725442"	"The lizard's death is on you!"
	"1463672916"	"Get out of my head!"
	"97258291"	"No one controls a god while I'm around!"
	"1925921701"	"There is something seriously wrong!"
	"3955386911"	"Not even the fates control me!"
	"2630179465"	"You should have made me kill myself, because that was your only chance!"
	"44158762"	"It's important to savor some of the special ones."
	"1973878716"	"My spear enters the void!"
	"3970936326"	"Now to find your litter to raid."
	"2611519120"	"Auf auf! Auf!"
	"2895070972"	"Auf auf auf auf!"
	"3683153514"	"Auf! Auf auf auf!"
	"186090241"	"After all I've done for you!"
	"2081469335"	"When you charge at me, you'd best not miss!"
	"483867250"	"I cannot see your wounds for the tears in my eyes..."
	"1808796388"	"Yours was a sad tale. But now it's over!"
	"4074330974"	"It is with a heart of stone I lay you to rest, Gorgon..."
	"2245946312"	"I would have once found your pursuits amusing, Necrophos. No more."
	"465239659"	"Fly-by-night, indeed!"
	"1824378621"	"Is this your knife in my shield, wastrel?"
	"4122255175"	"Attacking from all sides? A classic mistake!"
	"2192814033"	"None pass unseen into the underworld!"
	"302821952"	"This is why your kind should stick to frivolities."
	"1695253206"	"Of all the demons, you should have known better, Shadow Fiend."
	"2605655741"	"Stick to the sideshow work, magician!"
	"3964147243"	"What do you know? Silence is nice after all!"
	"1967212433"	"Power dependent upon allegiance is no power at all!"
	"38172423"	"You almost count for half a kill."
	"2619531940"	"You're out of practice, Spectre. Too soft for the real fight."
	"3945124402"	"That's from everyone!"
	"1915519880"	"You could have saved us all a lot of trouble and done this yourself."
	"86749982"	"I didn't come here to send you back, Terrorblade... Only to put you down."
	"2509549199"	"Well, found the cure for madness!"
	"3801325081"	"The gods will not suffer a mortal so clever as you."
	"2186549244"	"There were many who prayed for your death, Underlord. Prayers answered."
	"4115867498"	"Blow away!"
	"1224395775"	"I'm done with the dour. What reason have I to worry?"
	"1450924320"	"So how far can you throw that little goblin? Friendly competition?"
	"2801052371"	"You didn't need to go through all the trouble. I could have solved this problem for you ages ago."
	"948977520"	"Which one of you two would win in a fight?"
	"1335300070"	"People say we'd make a good team. But don't get carried away; I make a good team with anyone."
	"3600703068"	"Red skin in battle must be pretty convenient. Not that I'd need it, but you know... for you."
	"2711187146"	"So strange to see you when I'm awake, Bane. I thought you only came in pleasant dreams..."
	"824603483"	"Oh! This guy's creepy... Just what we needed!"
	"1176585165"	"What did I just step in?!"
	"652659240"	"I didn't catch your name, flappy."
	"1373764286"	"Don't worry. They don't even hurt the animals in the sacrifice, they only slaughter them."
	"3370691332"	"You'll love roaring in the arena!"
	"3220151186"	"This is going to be fun. Oh, and when we're done here, tell the Flayed Twins I'm coming for them. Happy hunting!"
	"562761265"	"I had a kind of a hound once. He got on mother's bad side..."
	"1452031655"	"If someone puts a contract on my father, I'll double your fee to leave him for me."
	"3481628445"	"No, I don't need your services, Bounty Hunter. Lot of names on my list, but I've got as long as it takes and longer!"
	"3095551883"	"All right! I was hoping we'd run into each other."
	"675103258"	"If you can't do it drunk, it's not worth doing."
	"1597665932"	"If you were under my command, turning your back would mean death."
	"231447019"	"Blood, viscera...the stench of battle? Don't mar it with your foul goo."
	"2060233085"	"Are any of these babies up for adoption?"
	"3821402311"	"Maybe I'll settle down and have kids someday..."
	"2495793233"	"Fancy seeing you here, Arachnia!"
	"178675186"	"I carry an apple for just such an occasion!"
	"2107731300"	"You're a bit ugly, but you might make a passable companion."
	"3836230878"	"There's a lot to like about you, Chaos Knight. But I don't get the feeling you're on my side..."
	"2477722696"	"And at my heels, the riders of a grim dawn!"
	"51384793"	"Honestly, Ken, you're lucky I acknowledge your presence at all."
	"1947672911"	"Hey, Ken, got a line on any chimeras?"
	"349218986"	"Maybe you should sit this one out if you're so worried about getting scratched..."
	"1675073596"	"What's your game, really, Maiden?"
	"4208904582"	"I know a thing or two about sibling rivalry. The only outcome is war!"
	"2379872528"	"The petty politics of your people are of little interest to me, faerie."
	"331181235"	"I feel inclined to like you for some reason, Disruptor..."
	"1689934885"	"I'm not interested in talking about my father. Or hearing about yours."
	"4256370079"	"You're fortunate, friend. Most mortals never know the power you now possess."
	"2327067913"	"All things considered, you should take more care around dying animals."
	"436936856"	"I always excelled at boulder toss as a child."
	"1607726411"	"Are we kin, Titan?"
	"2432394961"	"Why so serious? There's battle ahead!"
	"748031739"	"I think I've 'et some of your relatives!"
	"3047120705"	"I'll stay my spear today, Enigma. But I make no promises in the days to come."
	"3264770007"	"When you were a child, did you blow time bubbles?"
	"1560083060"	"Your personality paints me in an even godlier light."
	"737921762"	"I've done some--in hindsight--morally questionable things. But for fun! Your crimes just seem petty."
	"3002243928"	"You use the fire dust amusingly, Mr. Copter."
	"3321211854"	"Just get ready to drop that bomb in the arena!"
	"1430959711"	"Someday we will fight, and it will be glorious."
	"575506121"	"No, no, no! The priests are supposed to worship *you*, not the other way around."
	"1116344108"	"Yours is a special kind of vanity, Invoker."
	"898449338"	"Let me juggle your tiny orbs, Invoker!"
	"2894360064"	"My oldest friend... You've helped me through some dark times."
	"3682819734"	"No one gets me like you do, Io."
	"1172818741"	"Fire and ice! Reminds me of a song I once heard."
	"853605283"	"How does that mask stay on when you're spinning?"
	"2884217369"	"There must be something broken in your inner ear, Yurnero."
	"3706624655"	"Sing me a song, Admiral. The grog is working!"
	"1280411422"	"If only you'd met me sooner. I know someone with an amount of influence in matters nautical!"
	"995538824"	"I invented dueling, you know."
	"1772575983"	"Finally, someone with a proper sense of battle attire!"
	"513830009"	"Do you even know why we fight, creature?"
	"2276015555"	"Stick with me and you'll go as far as one of your ill fortune can get."
	"4037938517"	"It's fair to blame your parents, Lina. Sounds like the whole mess was really their fault."
	"1858771190"	"You pretend to be so wicked, Lion. But I saw you dancing!"
	"432908384"	"So you used to hurt folks and now try to help? How's it working out?"
	"2160392666"	"The mortal mind considers such gifts a curse?"
	"4156803404"	"I feel some good vibes coming off of you, new friend!"
	"1736234205"	"You're soft-headed, but I guess you mean well."
	"276554827"	"I'd heard stories, but you're even more annoying face to face..."
	"1891397038"	"My spear sings in harmony, Naga!"
	"129719608"	"Remind me never to step indoors with you. Phew!"
	"2662468738"	"I've followed some of your work, Night Stalker. I'm expecting big things!"
	"3920968724"	"Fascinating! There's a massive growth on this ogre's head!"
	"2010229175"	"Look, I humor you priest, but don't push it."
	"14063905"	"I'm always accepting new worshippers, Omniknight."
	"2581579931"	"That's not what an oracle looks like!"
	"4007196685"	"If you spoil the ending of this fight, I'll...Well, I'm sure you can work out the rest!"
	"2120738204"	"Most Gallants are complete idiots. You're not so bad!"
	"157340938"	"Pray to whatever god you believe in that my name never appears on your list."
	"3422739050"	"Do you even like your job, assassin?"
	"2149794295"	"Hey Lancer, need any tips?"
	"422187085"	"And to think, you could have died as just another pathetic mortal."
	"3736565124"	"You know, Quoidge wouldn't even exist without me."
	"4031362424"	"Today's going to be a busy day, butcher!"
	"2270070254"	"I would never guess we had so much in common!"
	"3916006838"	"It's all a pleasure to me too, Akasha."
	"1765860546"	"Oh great, the bureaucracy is here too..."
	"4194302291"	"Don't worry, Razor, no one's trying to have any fun here..."
	"2398669253"	"I don't know if you know this, but I can still kind of see you..."
	"3997122592"	"Folks seem to give you a wide berth, Rubick. Maybe wash the robes?"
	"2570612918"	"You remind me of a tutor I once killed."
	"3219724"	"Why, who'd want to be king of sand?"
	"2000032154"	"Get in there sandy claws! Hey, you said it first."
	"3914499129"	"Fighting demons is almost beneath me. So befriending one probably is too."
	"2656416943"	"A mortal has no business transmogrifying anything!"
	"123528469"	"Quiet is boring."
	"1885066627"	"Take it from me, Skywrath, that ship has sailed."
	"3773089810"	"Do you know how to whistle, Slardar?"
	"2548299908"	"The drylands are glad to have you in this fight, Slardar."
	"3242758417"	"I don't often associate with common criminals, but I'm feeling generous."
	"3058672007"	"It's funny because on one hand, look how you make war! But on the other, at least you make war..."
	"793178173"	"You take care of the boring stuff. I'll do the rest!"
	"1480704171"	"Where do you think you're going?!"
	"3324335368"	"Don't get started before I'm in the fray!"
	"2971821470"	"If anyone asks, you're the lord of thunder in my book!"
	"673920036"	"You should come to my next family reunion. You'd be a hit!"
	"1596720306"	"Break out a warcry, Sven! Or your heart's not in it!"
	"3482523939"	"Know any good fishing holes?"
	"3096717749"	"You do pretty well for a sniveling coward, Rizzrack!"
	"3629359184"	"Yours is a particularly foul kind of magic, Tinker. Almost any mortal might wield it!"
	"123019846"	"Teeny... Puny... Miniscule... Infinitesimal! There were plenty of better choices."
	"912114044"	"I'm only a handful of generations into this whole helping people thing. Any pointers?"
	"1096479210"	"I already tire of your antics, Troll..."
	"3745408073"	"The trolls I've killed have been a lot bigger..."
	"2822329567"	"You've got the right idea, Tusk. Most of these fools walk a grim path."
	"825230693"	"I'll see how well you fight before I bother talking to you..."
	"1178023411"	"Listen, you don't need to actually hum the dirge. It does just fine on its own."
	"2052943308"	"Funny, I'll never have a tombstone..."
	"2710509812"	"How can you stand that Razor fellow?"
	"4085183379"	"I appreciate your position, Visage, even if I don't desire it."
	"2222572293"	"Burn your scrolls, wizard! This is war, not some damned symposium!"
	"493916863"	"How do you even lift that tome, wizard?"
	"1786225193"	"I love how you slay with a smile, ranger."
	"4094900106"	"You're the oddest dragon I've ever seen, and I've seen Jakiro!"
	"2199127836"	"What do you want from me little man?! Oh, you're here to fight?"
	"438130342"	"Admit it, you wish you could be me, Ostarion."
	"1830446640"	"You had to work so hard for cutrate immortality..."
	"4255480737"	"Keep that thunder to yourself. I don't wanna hear it, Zeus."
	"2325891895"	"No, this isn't a chance to re-forge a broken bond. I'm not interested."
	"3932537554"	"Just shut up already! I know what I'm doing."
	"2640507460"	"It's been too long since you overthrew the titans, Zeus. Perhaps it's time for a new godly order."
	"74163198"	"I don't answer to that name anymore, you old fool."
	"1936495464"	"It's rare to see one of those beasties tamed!"
	"3976726219"	"Can he spit a bit of that on my spear here? "
	"2584688221"	"Ah la la la! I caaaan't heeaaar yoooouuu!"
	"50751463"	"Wait, I don't see any strings..."
	"1946244977"	"Why do you always have to make it weird, Void Spirit?"
	"3837676256"	"When I put an enemy in the arena, don't let them out!"
	"2478406262"	"Do you understand language, beastie?"
	"2770621461"	"You can chew on whatever I leave in my wake!"
	"3525534851"	"Together again. This time will be different, I promise!"
	"1261057337"	"Where does the time go, my dear? You've been away too long..."
	"1009583535"	"I respect your methods, Anti-Mage, but you've really got to lighten up!"
	"2722729996"	"Your filial defiance is inspiring, Doombringer."
	"3578699930"	"Are you ageless as well, traveller?"
	"1279783200"	"What kind of example are you setting for the youngsters, Ezalor?"
	"994099638"	"Long have I admired your steed, Ezalor."
	"2885671975"	"Of all the powers to seek...why demonkind?!"
	"3707301041"	"My apologies, Gorgon. I was in no position to help anyone in those days..."
	"3158271316"	"If my father showed any true leadership, your family's woes would never have come to pass."
	"3409466818"	"Stand back everyone! This ogre's going to cast a spell on you."
	"1378944120"	"You're a teetotaler? What does that mean?"
	"624309486"	"Do gods even have souls, demon? I thought we were kind of....pre-soul."
	"3142754637"	"A troll spellcaster? Huh! What will they think of next?"
	"3428159963"	"Nothing like going into battle a little shorthanded, eh? Hehehe."
	"1432141921"	"Break out the fireworks, little ones!"
	"576450807"	"So which innane demonic law did you run afoul of, Terrorblade?"
	"3001347430"	"Your kind don't need to fear me anymore, Tidehunter. Those capricious days are behind me."
	"3320045040"	"With your help, an army of spearmen could be outfitted in no time!"
	"2534553239"	"What do you mean you don't believe in gods, Tinker?"
	"3759474177"	"In the old days, I never stopped to admire how beautiful the battlefield really is."
	"2031900603"	"If you had a longer lifespan, you might really be something someday, Tusk!"
	"414072276"	"Shitty wizard!"
	"3753675178"	"Crummy wizard!"
	"3357518946"	"What's with this stupid wizard anyway?"
	"3409335113"	"Ha ha ha ha ha! Ah ha ha ha ha ha haa! Ah ha ha ha haaa!"
	"3339380109"	"Worthy of a god's praise!"
	"1577301047"	"I tip my spear!"
	"3812920066"	"You call yourself a god?"
	"2051922616"	"Get out of my sight!"
	"223013422"	"You'll never stand equal to Mars!"
