"
	"3204206141"	"Your graphics card falls below our official minimum specs,
which have not been changed in the transition to Dota 2 Reborn.
When running under the Source 1 engine, that did not prevent
the game from working because the engine was not designed around
the full capabilities of the minimum spec for graphic cards.
However, Dota 2 Reborn relies on graphics features such as vertex textures and shader model 3.0
and so adherence to the minimum spec is a stronger requirement
than it was in Source 1 Dota 2. Unfortunately this means that Dota 2 Reborn
will not be able to run on some graphics cards from 2006 or before.

	"653526698"	"I'm supposed to be scared of some mist? Please. I ride clouds for fun."
	"3221051152"	"Hey Abaddon, does killing you make me Monkey King, Lord of Avernus, or just King of Avernus?"
	"3371853702"	"Look on the bright side Alchemist: you can make yourself a potion to forget this fight."
	"1453257253"	"Alchemist, you could be riding that frost dragon and I'd still end you."
	"563724979"	"You shoulda stayed home, Apparition. You're not walking away from this."
	"3096482569"	"You think you're the first spirit I've dealt with?"
	"3482821535"	"For someone who says he's anti-magic you sure like teleporting around the battle field."

	"899674936"	"Let's be real, Maiden, your sister has all the talent."
	"1117307822"	"I don't care how good a tactician you are Dark Seer, you'll never see me comin."
	"3683750420"	"I'm going to flatten that pointy little head of yours."
	"2895553154"	"Alright Dazzle, show me what you got."

	"1173686199"	"Hey prophet, you see that coming?"
	"3707524621"	"Just stay dead already!"
	"2885379739"	"I like you better than Zeus, but I'm still gonna kill ya."
	"994343690"	"When are you lightning guys gonna realize you can't beat me."
	"1279478684"	"I'm sending you back to the Seven Hells."
	"746898041"	"Looks like you met your doom! Ok, I gotta workshop that, that was no good."
	"1535374063"	"So you're the famous Dragon Knight? Disapointing."
	"3263865685"	"I fight gods, what chance did a half dragon have?"
	"3045954499"	"I own this jungle!"
	"736691808"	"You never had a chance, Traxex."
	"1559115510"	"I'll crack you in half!"
	"3320276812"	"You shoulda stayed in the ground Kaolin."
	"3001047002"	"So, you're the one that stole my story."
	"576670283"	"Cute hammer, Earthshaker. Next time use it."
	"1431861981"	"Your time is up, old man!"
	"128553402"	"You never should've left your forge!"
	"1890492716"	"Sorry buddy!"
	"3920097430"	"You picked the wrong side, Xin!"
	"2661335040"	"You seemed nice, sorry!"
	"12866979"	"You should've stuck with singing to rabbits, huh. Fighting's not your thing."
	"2009294133"	"The Dark Fundementals must die!"
	"4006229135"	"It ends here, Enigma!"
	"2580349977"	"I won't have the gods undo my glory!"
	"158472584"	"Time's up!"
	"2121607454"	"Woo! Smashing this thing made my day!"
	"515023099"	"You're grounded!"
	"1773506669"	"I grant you the death you crave Huskar!"
	"4038902231"	"Sacred Warrior. How pedestrian."
	"2277241153"	"Stop talking already!"
	"434070754"	"You can't talk your way out of this one, Invoker."
	"1859671156"	"Two heads, and not a warrior between them."
	"4157670862"	"I was expecting a fight. How disappointing."
	"2161522008"	"Juggernaut, when I'm through with you there won't be any of your kind."
	"275327177"	"Heroes don't hide behind masks."
	"1735268447"	"Ezalor, you should have used that horse to run."
	"2569714740"	"You've had a good run Old Man, but it's my time now."
	"3995962530"	"You should have went down with your ship, pirate."
	"1998904600"	"Try to keep up, Kunkka."
	"2354574"	"Who put you in charge of a Legion?"
	"2655483949"	"I always heard the Bronze Legion was weak, and now I see why!"
	"3913304251"	"It's all over Leshrac!"
	"1883838721"	"Begone Leshrac!"
	"2549167110"	"You're an abomination!"
	"3774219408"	"You were safer in that dungeon, Lifestealer."
	"2150731125"	"Your name's Lifestealer'? Hohoho! Man, this joke writes itself."
	"4147559907"	"Your sister was right about you, you are overrated."
	"1849683033"	"I didn't want it to go this way Lina."
	"423156943"	"You're finished Demon Witch!"
	"2270972268"	"I'll send you back to hell!"
	"4032526842"	"Wish you had friends now, huh Druid?"
	"1766991936"	"No one rules nature, but me!"
	"508893398"	"Your pet can't help you Luna!"
	"2397701447"	"You brought this on yourself!"
	"4193072593"	"I'll put you down like the dog you are."
	"3660004007"	"Your pack is finished, Lycan!"
	"2904558129"	"Speed beats strength everytime! Haha!"
	"875125643"	"Give it up Magnus, you can't catch me."
	"1127115549"	"Well, you and Zeus deserve each other"
	"3712679614"	"You're finished Medusa!"
	"2857225768"	"Bring as many copies as you want, you're all dead!"
	"860135314"	"It'll take more than 5 of you!"
	"1145286404"	"You're making this too easy Mirana."
	"3573330581"	"Goodbye Princess."
	"2751169027"	"No one out transforms me!"
	"3275492326"	"It ends here Morphling!"
	"3023780720"	"You've sang your last song, Siren!"
	"758278858"	"No one tries to control the Monkey King!"
	"1513445980"	"Pulling root was your ruin, Prophet."
	"3293695999"	"Trees offer no protection from me."
	"3008823145"	"You're done preying on the weak Necrophos!"
	"710913747"	"Going up against me, Necrophos? That's just masochistic."
	"1566088773"	"I've heard a lot of stories about you. I guess this is the last one."
	"3454501844"	"Mistake me for easy prey, Night Stalker? You're a fairy tale. And I'm a legend."
	"3893450789"	"No one tries to assassinate the Monkey King and lives!"
	"2669045939"	"Haha. You amuse me, Ogres. Pity."
	"102709513"	"Twice the ogre? Try half the challenge."
	"1897400735"	"Sycophant!"
	"4017921084"	"Where's your Omniscience now?"
	"2558241962"	"Tell me you saw this coming."
	"24313104"	"I'll trust my staff over your whispered dreams, Oracle."
	"1987431814"	"It's adorable. You think you can stop me."
	"3872051223"	"Hadn't you heard? Imprisoning me just makes me stronger."
	"2446188673"	"Didn't your sisters warn you about me, Assassin?"
	"4043991396"	"The Phantom Veil becomes your shroud, Mortred."
	"2249021938"	"Honestly, I don't see the resemblance."
	"520357960"	"That's my trick, ghost man. And I do it better."
	"1745041630"	"You were adorable before I killed you."
	"4133989757"	"Sorry, Puck. The battlefield's no place for you."
	"2170592747"	"You disgust me Pudge. Oh, not morally or anything, you're just gross."
	"409586769"	"Here, piggy, piggy!"
	"1869544647"	"You haven't earned anything, runt."
	"4291944790"	"The battlefield's no place for tantrums, Pugna."
	"2295779776"	"Back to hell, succubus. This kingdom needs no Queen."
	"3192651683"	"Your reign is over!"
	"3377254197"	"Your days of torment are over, Razor!"
	"1346739855"	"I'm not some rat in your maze."
	"658681369"	"I wish I could unsee you, Riki."
	"3106290618"	"Oh, sorry! Didn't see you."
	"3458272044"	"I don't steal spells, Rubick, I take lives."
	"1462262422"	"Grand Magus? Guess that was just another fairy tale."
	"539978240"	"Many claim the crown, Sand Thing, few bear the weight."
	"2962257809"	"King? Hardly."
	"3348580103"	"I've dealt with your puppets before. It's nice to kill the real thing."
	"2807090914"	"I'll always know which one is real, Shadow Demon."
	"3495427700"	"I won't let you claim another soul!"
	"1230942158"	"It's over Nevermore. You're finished!"
	"1046060888"	"You're nothing a but a petty thug."
	"2688355067"	"I know a huckster when I see one."
	"3610917485"	"Oh, shut up."
	"1311992791"	"Had to kill you before you bored me to death."
	"959732545"	"From the greatest heights fall the biggest cowards."
	"2844477136"	"Are those things made of wax, Skywrath?"
	"3733747270"	"You're the ugliest thing I've seen, Slardar. And I've seen a lot."
	"2357042465"	"Not even the Siren could protect you."
	"4219121079"	"Couldn't escape that, could you?"
	"1651768333"	"Your sentence isn't life this time, Slark, it's death."
	"359976091"	"You think your toy levels the playing field?"
	"2333104440"	"That cowardly weapon has no place on my battlefield, Sniper."
	"4229392814"	"Enunciate!"
	"303630466"	"Stupid cow."
	"2191922451"	"Bara, you had all of existence to choose from, and you picked a fight with me? Idiot."
	"4120978821"	"You'll have to try harder than that Storm Spirit."
	"2506533984"	"Every storm eventually blows out, Raijin."
	"3798047990"	"I'm not saying there's always a connection between excessive braun and mental deficiency."
	"2070465868"	"Haha, Sven. You thought you could keep up with me? There are trees everywhere!"
	"208666074"	"No one likes you, Techies. Just go away."
	"2450221177"	"Saved you the trouble. Idiots."
	"3842791663"	"You should've stuck to the library, Lanaya."
	"2080704853"	"The Temple will have to find a new errand girl."
	"184695235"	"You do know that demon killing's kind of my thing, right?"
	"2612864082"	"Your name is more impressive than your actual skills."
	"3971617988"	"I made a bet with Kunkka that I'd bag you first."
	"318681263"	"Sorry, Tidehunter, you'll have to settle for burial at river."
	"1710850105"	"Ever wondered if maybe your city had it comin', Rizzrack?"
	"4243640707"	"The trees have been saying some very bad things about you, Timbersaw."
	"2348278037"	"I have brains and braun, Tinker. "
	"361985206"	"I have respect for your ingenuity, Tinker. But I'm still crushing your skull."
	"1653883936"	"Only room in this lane for one stoney killer, Tiny."
	"4221375898"	"I get it. Your name's ironic. Good bye."
	"2358912268"	"The trees will be just fine without you."
	"472201373"	"I always wanted to take up woodcarving."
	"1797392395"	"You got spirit Warlord, I'll give you that."
	"199590382"	"Trolls. Always a challenge, never an obstacle."
	"2095231352"	"You threw your life away for a bet, Tusk? I like that."
	"3857440962"	"You wanted to fight in a war, Tusk? I give you war!"
	"2464993364"	"Get back in your pit, Underlord."
	"210257399"	"So much fanfare. So much disappointment."
	"2072999265"	"You've forgotten your life. None will remember your death."
	"3800442075"	"He seemed to die just fine to me."
	"2508264525"	"Your kin are safe from me, Ursa. If they don't follow your mistake."
	"87951836"	"You chose the wrong friends, noble beast. "
	"1916352842"	"Return to your unquiet grave, spirit!"
	"3630269694"	"Come back for vengeance, and I'll do that again."
	"2942743656"	"You think you're the scariest thing in the Jungle?"
	"913302994"	"That's the biggest banana slug I've ever seen."
	"1097389380"	"Monkey vs snake. Monkey wins. Monkey always wins!"
	"3742122215"	"Let's see if your poison's good for cleaning off blood."
	"2819321969"	"You hold no sway over me, Visage."
	"822223307"	"I'm on no lists, Visage. Seek elsewhere."
	"1174737245"	"Men, demons, men with demons. Makes no difference to me."
	"3602517196"	"I've killed a thousand men like you, Warlock. I'll happily kill a thousand more."
	"2713533530"	"Not hard catching bugs when you use a stick."
	"3246044607"	"I'm reminded of a delicacy I tried in the Palace of Hurra'agdu. One of your brood, perhaps."
	"3061679401"	"Traxex was right about you: you are a middling talent."
	"796185747"	"Congratulations, Windranger. You did get there first."
	"1483990021"	"Killed one kind of dragon, killed 'em all."
	"3323425190"	"You didn't do your homework, Wyvern."
	"672731274"	"And I'm taking your monkey friend with me."
	"1595809820"	"In which ditch should we bury you, doctor?"
	"3483450765"	"King? Ha!"
	"3097890075"	"Get back up again, I dare you."
	"3931629180"	"You should have turned yourself into swan and hid, you bastard."
	"2639320810"	"As a god, Zeus, you were lacking, but this?! "
	"72976208"	"Zeus? Never heard of him."
	"1935587270"	"You need to work on the fundamentals, Io."
	"3980010085"	"Look at that, a falling star!"
	"2587693811"	"Stay in the ashes, Phoenix."
	"53756745"	"Oh, I hate birds."
	"672501155"	"Quick question Abaddon: when you say 'Lord of Avernus' is that by birth or by marriage?"
	"2971458585"	"Hey Abaddon, I know you got the mist thing down, but can you make clouds?"
	"3323718799"	"So you met in jail, huh? I was stuck in solitary."
	"1484749100"	"Listen Ogre, some financial advice? If that little man stiffs you out of any of your money, beat him to death."
	"796412346"	"Listen ghost, if you're ever gonna ask the Crystal Maiden out on that date, you better start working on those ice puns."
	"3060865024"	"Here's the plan: you freeze 'em, and I'll smash their face in."
	"3245746326"	"So when you say 'you'll bring an end to magic', you don't mean loveable talking monkey royalty right?"
	"1372140807"	"Anti-Mage you need to smile more."
	"651036049"	"Alright it's just a suggestion: take it or leave it at your leisure. But maybe you should start talking in the first person."
	"1175030900"	"Arc Warden, you're not planning on sticking me in the moon or anything like that?"
	"823049442"	"I think it's great you commissioned Goodkind to write about you.  I mean, people talk about me for free but - good for you."
	"2819091800"	"Axe, you and I are gonna hurt a whole lot of people."
	"3741375950"	"Ya know, nightmare bringing aside, you're a pleasant guy to work with."
	"1097091181"	"You want a good nightmare to torment people? Have 'em trapped inside a rock. It's brutal."
	"912488699"	"After the battle you mind if I take the bat for a spin?"
	"2942970177"	"So, how long have you and the bat been an item?"
	"3631028695"	"You like animals. I am an animal. I think you and I are gonna get along just fine."
	"1221723206"	"Ditch the boar, my friend, primates are where it's at."
	"1070937296"	"Stick with me and you'll find all the blood you need."
	"1831133111"	"Bloodseeker, your work is messy but necessary."
	"438562593"	"Try to keep up, Gondar!"
	"2200616603"	"Scarves are hard to pull off, but it really works on you Bounty Hunter."
	"4096626189"	"Brewmaster, after we kill their ancient we are getting loaded."
	"1783176110"	"So how does one become a brewmaster? Is it hours as an apprentince, an accredited course, self given title?"
	"491662136"	"When this is all over you, me, and Brewmaster should just get loaded and pick some fights."
	"2219276930"	"Oh, I wish I could have seen that bar fight between you and Tusk."
	"4081076756"	"Let's just get through this Arachnia."
	"1677678469"	"Would it kill you to walk around like how we first met?"
	"351823635"	"Nice belt. What does it do?"
	"1950346998"	"Centaur, you should really climb a tree sometime, you don't know what you're missing"
	"54058592"	"Me, you, and Phantom Lancer should start up an illusory exclusive club."
	"2586939354"	"Nice horse. "
	"3979788108"	"Just promise me you won't control me, ok Chen?"
	"1934764783"	"Ethically speaking, how are you ok with marching helpless creatures off to their demise?"
	"72686201"	"Ya mind if I call you Bones? Because whenever I hear Clinkz I start looking for a clockwork creature 'n I get really confused."
	"2640071619"	"You're a hero Clinkz. Not enough people give you credit for that."
	"2061788868"	"You lock 'em down tin man, I'll take care of the rest"
	"233002578"	"Hey Rylai, you think you could introduce me to Lina?"
	"998144049"	"Alright Maiden, let's have some fun."
	"1283016871"	"You think too much Dark Seer. Try living by instinct sometimes."
	"3580893469"	"A plan is a list of things that don't happen, Dark Seer. Live in the moment."
	"2725718411"	"Dazzle: you keep me alive and I'll keep knockin' em in the dirt."
	"1007926312"	"Alright Shadow priest, try to keep up!"
	"1259637950"	"Prophet, I get that it's your thing, but try not to die OK?"
	"3525172484"	"Lady, you're creeping me out."
	"2770005394"	"Hey Disruptor: you're with me that Zeus is a jerk, right?"
	"1117962389"	"Doom, huh? Your mom musta loved you."
	"577063280"	"So, Doom. The Seven Hells. That sounds cozy."
	"1432517094"	"Half dragon, my cloud's in the shop. Can I ride you into battle?"
	"3429574748"	"Let me know when you turn into a dragon and kill everyone. I love that part."
	"3144423626"	"Hey Traxex, I don't know what that other archer was talking about, you're not an emotionally vacant husk of perpetual sadness."
	"621317481"	"I don't want to stick my nose in Ranger business, but that redhead wasn't saying the most kind things about you."
	"1376763391"	"Just stay away from me, Kaolin."
	"3406228549"	"Don't talk to me and we wont have any problems, Earth Spirit."
	"3154238675"	"What's up with the Earth trying to keep guys like us down?"
	"750698818"	"We should start up an 'imprisoned in earth' support group."
	"1538912724"	"So, Elder Titan. You're really old."
	"155720371"	"Alright, old man titan, watch and see how it's done."
	"2119117349"	"When this is over we're gonna have a chat about what you did."
	"3880156063"	"You and your brothers are dead to me Xin."
	"2420198153"	"Not gonna lie, Enchantress: aside from Monkeys, I kind of hate animals."
	"237362858"	"Enchantress, you are impossibly cheerful"
	"2032332348"	"Enigma, you are one scary force of nature."
	"3760963462"	"Hey Enigma, remember when you tricked that Alchemist? Oh, ha! Good times."
	"2536279824"	"I think I liked you better as a dinosaur."
	"127111809"	"Excuse me, Mr. Void - is the Monkey Kingdom bound by the Clazemere Treaty?"
	"1888789015"	"You are an annoying little man in an annoying little plane."
	"273886194"	"I hate you Gyrocopter."
	"1733565284"	"You and Dazzle should really just have a drink and hug it out."
	"4267526878"	"Huskar, I'm not trying to tell you how to live your life, but getting sacrificed is a bad thing."
	"2304408136"	"I know a thing or two about egomaniacs: and Invoker, you're one of the worst."
	"390000619"	"We get it Invoker, you're smart. Now can we kill these guys?"
	"1614405501"	"Jakiro, Dragon Knight won't play ball: but you'll let me ride you, right?"
	"4180709063"	"Glad you're on our side Jakiro."
	"2386017873"	"You gotta tell me what happened on the Isle of Masks."
	"512271296"	"Juggernaut, is it true you and Templar Assassin used to be a thing?"
	"1771017046"	"You gotta show me how to do that lightshow trick Ezalor."
	"2546677565"	"Keeper, I was thinking next Thursday would be a good day for my 'fundamental ascension' ceremony, that work for you?"
	"3771467691"	"Kunnka, I'm not trying to be rude but you got something on your forehead."
	"2042975761"	"Let's do this Kunkka."
	"247621255"	"You realize you basically named your Legion 3rd place, right?"
	"2426860324"	"Tresdin, I don't care what armies you've lead: you don't tell me what to do."
	"3886138290"	"Great. Another old guy that throws lightning around."
	"2124976648"	"Just try not to electrocute me, ok Leshrac?"
	"162505374"	"Ya know for a mage that's cheated death you're personable."
	"2568011535"	"You don't really warm up to people much, do you Lich?"
	"3994521497"	"Lifestealer, is that a family name? Or more of an occuptaion, like haberdasher?"
	"2395997820"	"So, you were in prison a long time. Got any good stories?"
	"4191631082"	"Hey Lina, after we win can I buy you a drink?"
	"1625188176"	"Soooo Lina. Your sister tell you about me?"
	"400119750"	"Lion, your name is very misleading."
	"2310914661"	"So, Demon Witch, that's a helluva title."
	"4273664755"	"So are you 'Lone Druid' because you're the last druid? Or because you hate hanging out with other Druids?"
	"1739825993"	"Sylla; you, me, and that bear of yours are gonna win this battle."
	"280269791"	"Hey Luna, nice wolf."
	"2148240974"	"We should go on a moonlit walk sometime.  You know, after we kill a whole lot of people."
	"4144807640"	"Lycan, you gotta step up your transformation game."
	"2750768008"	"I'll help you reclaim Ambry, Lycan."
	"3572650782"	"You are a large man, Magnus."
	"1308295844"	"Hey Magnus, I want to start up a conservation group, you in?"
	"989606450"	"I saw you and Zeus at the Sundered Moon the other night, he's married you know."
	"2761467793"	"So, does your hair ever get tangles? Or does it always just look good?"
	"3550451463"	"You're underrated Meepo."
	"1251395261"	"Guys like us gotta stick together Meepo."
	"2905533370"	"I summered in Nightsilver before. Lovely trees."
	"3660176172"	"Try not to get me wet, Morphling."
	"3136180937"	"Morphling, you are a lot more intimidating in person than your name suggests."
	"3454624351"	"You got a helluva voice Siren."
	"1423979493"	"The Deep Ones are lucky to have you on their side."
	"602342259"	"Just don't go moving the trees when I need 'em, Prophet."
	"3179517648"	"Forcing trees to fight goes against their nature, Prophet."
	"3397690950"	"Ugh! Cover your mouth when you cough, Necrophos. You disgust me."
	"1401812988"	"Don't steal my kills and we'll get along just fine."
	"613074794"	"I guess you're not useless half the time, Night Stalker. That's pretty good."
	"3023428347"	"Do we really have to wait til night to start fighting?"
	"3274893933"	"Who invited the zealot?"
	"2445476106"	"Nyx, I don't wanna see you this battle"
	"3871617436"	"So, do both heads need to eat?"
	"2144165926"	"You're lucky you know, one of you can focus on the battle and the other can watch me be fantastic."
	"147476656"	"You've taken the power, Omniknight. It's yours. Stop kowtowing."
	"2528036115"	"Your powers may be real, but I've never seen this Omniscience."
	"3786012037"	"Never tell me the odds."
	"2023793727"	"I can see the future, too, Oracle. It looks like victory."
	"262640809"	"Just so you know, I have a strict no-astral-imprisonment policy."
	"2669185336"	"Stop looking at me like that."
	"3894393262"	"Just admit it, Phantom Assassin, you kill because you like it. "
	"2295869515"	"I'm not one of the 5 names on the list right?"
	"4292804829"	"You're a handsome fellow!"
	"1725321575"	"It's quite the honor to be mistaken for me"
	"298934769"	"Where is that Undertree, Puck? I might like to climb it."
	"2411066450"	"You should become my plucky sidesick, Puck."
	"4172465348"	"Old friend! Oh. Thought you were someone else."
	"1639683454"	"Do me a favor and try not to get puss on me."
	"381461992"	"Strange bedfellows, huh Pugna?"
	"2248390777"	"No, I don't want to see your nether ward. Stop asking."
	"4043606255"	"Sorry Akasha, I'm not looking for a Queen."
	"3348735628"	"You and Osterion would make a helluva power couple."
	"2963183130"	"For someone without a discernable face, Razor, you sure look smug."
	"697812896"	"Be careful Razor, one day that whip will be turned on you."
	"1586558774"	"Didn't think I'd be seeing you here, Riki."
	"3237241493"	"I'm friends with an alarming amount of assassins."
	"3086176771"	"How about a friendly duel, Rubick? I've heard some things."
	"788136889"	"Us tricksters need to stick together, eh, Rubick?"
	"1509765935"	"Fighting by your side goes against every instinct I have."
	"3376557758"	"I know a fellow you should talk to, Sand King. Fast friends, the two of you."
	"3192200744"	"A demon watching my back. There's a first time for everything."
	"3733100493"	"I'm something of a demon myself, you know."
	"2844108635"	"Keep your hands off my soul and we'll get along just fine."
	"814544609"	"I'm not afraid to name you friend, Shadow Fiend."
	"1200342647"	"I'm a fan of your work Shaman, a good con is a thing of beauty."
	"3656340436"	"Are your grifting days all behind you, Shadow Shaman?"
	"2934465346"	"I'll do the talking, Silencer."
	"937505528"	"Your voice really carries, Silencer. A bit too much."
	"1088815726"	"Are all birdmen this morose? Just you?"
	"3495501823"	"Know your problem?  Too subservient. Be your own birdman for once."
	"2807967593"	"You're the ugliest thing I've ever seen, Slardar. No offense."
	"4121936910"	"I think I like hanging out with Siren better."
	"2192110744"	"You get inked in Dark Reef?"
	"463578402"	"They don't know what it's like inside. Right, Slark?"
	"1822856628"	"Careful not to shoot me in the back, Sniper."
	"4072800279"	"Just stay away from my kills, Sniper."
	"2244292737"	"If you need help, Spectre, just shout unintelligibly. "
	"483156283"	"We gotta work on your communication skills Spectre."
	"1808486829"	"Don't go running off without me, Spirit Breaker."
	"4218702908"	"You're almost crazier than I am, Spirit Breaker."
	"2356378794"	"I've seen Xin and Kaolin. Where's your other brother?"
	"3971282255"	"Just make me a damn cloud."
	"2612250073"	"How do you see anything with that helment on, Sven?"
	"45782115"	"Come on, Sven. Time to drop the hammer on someone!"
	"1975362805"	"Wanna spring some traps, Techies?"
	"3956879702"	"I'll line 'em up, Techies. You'll know when to press the button."
	"2631795136"	"What happened with you and Juggernaut?"
	"97996922"	"Thought all this Ancients business was beneath you, Lanaya."
	"1926258924"	"Why do you spend so much time in your lesser form, Terrorblade?"
	"3798957437"	"I've seen my fair share of demonic brotherhoods. They might have considered you."
	"2506640875"	"Just watch it with the splashing, Tidehunter."
	"1798105472"	"Just jump in there and do your thing, Tidehunter. I'm right behind you."
	"472635670"	"We talked about this, Timbersaw. No clearcutting!"
	"2233632940"	"If I can't leap to the fight, Timbersaw, you know who to blame. "
	"4062558266"	"So Tinker, was it head trauma that made you dream all that up?"
	"1816210841"	"I can appreciate a man unconstrained by what the world tells him's possible."
	"457579791"	"So Tiny's just a not-so-clever name then."
	"2186235061"	"We've actually got something in common, Tiny. What kind of stone are you?"
	"4115168291"	"The trees respect you, Treant, but they love me."
	"1710711218"	"Yes, yes, Treant. I remember. No climbing. "
	"317739300"	"I didn't think you went in for team sports, Troll."
	"1916262593"	"My friend Breklin is a big fan of your work, Warlord."
	"87091287"	"Tusk! I like a fellow who does what he says and says what he does."
	"2621028845"	"So, Tusk. What can you tell me about Rylai?"
	"3946744187"	"Where we going today, Underlord?"
	"1968839896"	"What's the worst place you've accidentally rift'd to?"
	"39660622"	"I think there are better ways to do it, Undying, but to each his own."
	"2606005748"	"Undying? Yeah, me too."
	"3964882274"	"Ursa! I welcome you to my fight."
	"2095862003"	"The world needs more bears like you, Ursa."
	"199975013"	"I'm with you - I like making people pay for what they did too."
	"2712919505"	"I like a lady that goes after what she wants."
	"3602181447"	"You should visit my Kingdom sometime."
	"1337834749"	"Just try not to spit on me, ok?"
	"951749739"	"You're not exciting, Viper, but you sure get the job done."
	"2799573448"	"You're Viper? Don't look like one to me."
	"3520670046"	"Send your birds aloft, Visage. Let's find some prey."
	"1221621988"	"Don't have to worry about me, Visage. I won't be traversing the Narrow Maze."
	"1071073394"	"Can I borrow that book when you're done with it, Warlock?"
	"2942850531"	"I always did enjoy a good demon story."
	"3631179125"	"No hard feelings, right, Weaver?"
	"3098078352"	"Weaver, don't let the bastards keep you down."
	"3484408838"	"You don't fool me, Lyralei. I see the killer behind that smile."
	"1453755836"	"I don't know what Traxxex was talking about, you're not completely useless at all."
	"564247850"	"Tell me, Wyvern, which story about me is your favorite?"
	"3217369225"	"Wyvern, my life is poetry."
	"3368163359"	"I like your style, Witch Doctor."
	"1372277157"	"What's in that cask, anyway, Witch Doctor? "
	"650934579"	"We might as well make the best of it, Ostarion."
	"3061015714"	"I'll fight beside you, but I'm not callin' you king, Wraith."
	"3245626420"	"It's no secret I don't like you, Zeus. Well, it isn't a secret now. That didn't go as planned."
	"2475016019"	"It's ok, Zeus. You're one of the good ones. Today."
	"3833761733"	"Not much of a conversationalist, eh, Io?"
	"2106318463"	"Don't take this the wrong way, Phoenix, but if one of us has to die, I'd rather it be you."
	"3953065226"	"Shitty wizard!"
	"747391348"	"Crummy wizard!"
	"1679059747"	"Haaa."
	"2316962319"	"Haaaa."
	"4246551193"	"Ahhhhh."

	"3659133732"	"Na."
	"4273713215"	"This story's as good as written."
	"1739776389"	"My greatest triumph is yet to come."
	"280350995"	"I travelled a long way to get here."
	"2396079280"	"Don't look so surprised, human. My arrival was foretold."
	"4191581222"	"Looks like I've got some new stories to tell."
	"3345810379"	"Looks like I've got some new stories to tell."
	"922784773"	"The King has arrived."
	"3071472894"	"A new journey is about to begin."
	"3222652008"	"I need no introduction!"
	"1584484811"	"Equal of Heaven, greater than gods."
	"2919876031"	"Time to pick a fight."
	"3641636137"	"Everyone can relax; the Monkey King has arrived."
	"1198153866"	"Oh, there'll be stories about this fight."
	"1495045586"	"These guys aren't gonna know what hit them."
	"773563716"	"My next great challenge will be your last."
	"1323052193"	"Hope they put up a decent fight."
	"970660919"	"None can stand againt Sun Wukong."
	"2841903526"	"I've been waiting for a challenge."
	"1128778581"	"Some of the tales you hear about me are truer than others."
	"3662584559"	"The origins of my staff? How much time do you have?"
	"2907286137"	"I should have known a weapon worthy of my talents wouldn't be found in an armory."
	"858603482"	"I didn't find this staff by chance, it called out to me. It longed to take part in my legend."
	"4062087920"	"The Narrow Maze is only a labyrinth if you stick to the path."
	"1796725578"	"It wasn't my name alone purged from the underworld's ledger. My army will outlive you all."
	"470871004"	"I was fearless before I was immortal. But now -- haha -- the gods fear me!"
	"3689629414"	"My enemies thought the flames would consume me; they made me stronger!"
	"1122113372"	"Fire in my belly, fight in my blood."
	"904210378"	"Some legends burn out. I tend to flare up and leave the place in shambles."
	"2799892701"	"It's cloudy with a high chance of bloodshed."
	"1072408935"	"Storm cloud's a-comin'."
	"1223465457"	"Let's ride."
	"3599240274"	"Knew I'd left that cloud somewhere."
	"2710518980"	"The difference, Zeus, is that I make this look good."
	"3285836751"	"This story's as good as written."
	"1523626613"	"My greatest triumph is yet to come."
	"769098467"	"I travelled a long way to get here."
	"3014858560"	"Don't look so surprised, human. My arrival was foretold."
	"3300141014"	"Looks like I've got some new stories to tell."
	"812470300"	"Hmhmhmm. This should be interesting."
	"3731042608"	"I've outwitted gods. Smashing a glowing rock should be no problem."
	"695624029"	"Perhaps a challenge at last."
	"2961125607"	"The Monkey King"
	"3346530417"	"Monkey King"
	"1472667104"	"Sun Wukong"
	"549465462"	"These fools won't know what hit 'em."
	"87488135"	"I know all the tales."
	"2174922767"	"Try to keep up."
	"413917621"	"Follow me, and see how it's done.."
	"1873596707"	"Where I go, an army follows."
	"420009269"	"Too easy."
	"2147583119"	"I'm just getting started!"
	"4144411673"	"First Blood! Ha! I'm just getting started."
	"1768038842"	"First Blood! Well, not first blood, I've killed lots of people I just- well you get the idea."
	"509940012"	"First Blood! Well, today anyway."
	"2327826174"	"Time to move."
	"330735428"	"Let's go."
	"1689366482"	"Where to?"
	"4208278129"	"Hope we find trouble."
	"2379352807"	"Lets move."
	"349920093"	"Time to pick a fight."
	"1675389899"	"Ok."
	"4083381850"	"On it."
	"2221164236"	"Let's get a move on."
	"3835940649"	"Where's my cloud?"
	"2477064127"	"I'm ready."
	"179154437"	"Trouble, here I come."
	"2108333715"	"They can't stop me."
	"3821931312"	"They won't know what hit them."
	"2496215974"	"On the move."
	"230713884"	"Moving to position."
	"2059885194"	"Ready for anything."
	"3933751067"	"Ooh. Let's pick a fight."
	"2642376589"	"I'll go where the action is."
	"3482229994"	"Time to make something happen."
	"3096030332"	"Yes."
	"562101702"	"Eh."
	"1451740496"	"Right."
	"3370342643"	"Very well."
	"3219417189"	"I journey forth."
	"653081055"	"Mmhm."
	"1374292297"	"Yes."
	"3243578584"	"Yes."
	"3058836558"	"Yeah."
	"3600133547"	"Yeah."
	"2710740285"	"Ok."
	"949734535"	"Got it."
	"1335688209"	"M'hm."
	"3522718130"	"From here, to there."
	"1073088670"	"Yes."
	"1223768072"	"Yes."
	"3629000089"	"Yes."
	"2940802319"	"M'hm!"
	"3369941845"	"It ends here!"
	"1372875503"	"It's over!"
	"651385465"	"You think you can beat me?!"
	"3099054042"	"Come on!"
	"3484483404"	"Hoho. You're outta your league."
	"1455009526"	"Show me what you got!"
	"566140512"	"Do you know who I am?!"
	"2969666545"	"Oh, I'm gonna enjoy this."
	"3322327911"	"You should've stayed home."
	"2797681282"	"Of course."
	"3519416852"	"Ha! It's what I do."
	"1221548974"	"Count on it."
	"1070099256"	"Keep it coming."
	"2712469147"	"Who's next?!"
	"1378641445"	"Hayah!"
	"3408213919"	"Oowah!"

	"417566779"	"Hyah!"
	"2015631838"	"Ha!"
	"1506163427"	"They're gonna be telling stories about this."
	"784403061"	"Man, I make this look good."
	"3073923437"	"Haha!"
	"774965463"	"Whoo!"
	"1496725569"	"Over here!"
	"3344084450"	"Here we go!"
	"2958400884"	"No one's catching me."
	"693947598"	"You can see everything up here."
	"1583086680"	"Incoming! Woo!"
	"3471106505"	"Taking the high ground."

	"1015326521"	"So long!"
	"1266915247"	"It's over!"
	"3588686348"	"Watch this trick."
	"2732602010"	"Should've run while you had the chance."
	"1005151008"	"Hard to run with a broken spine."
	"1290687414"	"No!"
	"3696315943"	"No!"
	"2874572465"	"Uh, no."
	"3415340884"	"No!"
	"3163998146"	"Aha! No you don't."
	"1385735918"	"Nope! Don't think so."
	"3153789915"	"No!"

	"1860749427"	"Time to have some fun."
	"4035730896"	"Out of sight, out of mind."
	"2274061638"	"Lycan's got 1 transformation. I got 72."
	"511851772"	"Mm Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmmmm."
	"945475130"	"Here I come."

	"2165144901"	"Come back after you had some practice!"
	"296902868"	"Another one down!"

	"1385616652"	"I'm supposed to be scared of some mist? Please. I ride clouds for fun."
	"3416229046"	"So Abaddon, does killing you make me Monkey King, Lord of Avernus, or just King of Avernus?"
	"3164124192"	"Look on the bright side Alchemist: you can make yourself a potion to forget this fight."
	"586948995"	"Alchemist, you could be riding that frost dragon and I'd still end you."
	"1442517269"	"You shoulda stayed home, Apparition. You're not walking away from this."
	"3438428335"	"You think you're the first spirit I've delt with?"
	"3153424441"	"For someone who says he's anti-magic you sure like teleporting around the battle field."
	"726298024"	"Anti-Mage, beating hypocrites like you never gets old."
	"1548574014"	"Alright fishbowl head, show me what you've got."
	"1015731419"	"Arc Warden, I'll take you seriously the moment you start talking in the first person."
	"1267590221"	"Axe, this is the fight I've looked forward to for a long time."
	"3531912695"	"I hope Goodkind is taking notes, because people are gonna love reading about me killing you."
	"2776860001"	"You think bad dreams are gonna stop me?"
	"1004998850"	"Bane, the only one going to sleep today is you."
	"1289756756"	"For god's sake you're a chump that rides a bat, not Nevermore."
	"3588846062"	"Out of the way, vermin!"
	"2733523320"	"No one is my master!"
	"844193001"	"This forrest belongs to me!"
	"1163291775"	"You don't need to hunt me down, I'm right here."
	"396855064"	"The only blood being spilt here is yours."
	"1621145486"	"If you think you can bring me down, Bounty Hunter, you got another thing coming."
	"4188661300"	"I'm one bounty you're never cashing in."
	"2393822882"	"Your license is about to get revoked."
	"281690881"	"I know a thing or two about drunken masters: and you my friend, are just the town lush."
	"1741517719"	"You come at me and I'm taking your other eye."
	"4274266669"	"The beating tusk gave you will feel like a sweet memory when I'm done with you."

	"1853571004"	"There's no room for 2 half man half animal warriors!"
	"247248473"	"Warrunner, you were only champion of your arena because you never fought me."
	"2042332879"	"Your search for the light ends here, Chaos Knight!"
	"3769816949"	"There's only room for one agent of chaos on this battlefield."
	"2545280995"	"I'll destroy every one of your puppets, Chen!"
	"164721216"	"Die, slaver!"
	"2127971030"	"I'll put you in the ground where you belong!"
	"3890156396"	"I'll give you the final rest you've been begging for, Archer."
	"2430084090"	"I'll pry you out of that tin can!"
	"6766187"	"That armor won't save you little man."
	"2002783997"	"You gonna fight back or just make stupid ice puns all day?"
	"1107107998"	"Let's be real, Maiden, your sister has all the talent."
	"922357768"	"I don't care how good a tactician you are Dark Seer, you'll never see me comin."
	"2951954866"	"I'm gonna flatten that pointy little head of yours."
	"3639898404"	"Alright Dazzle, show me what you got."

	"832033809"	"Hey prophet, you see that coming?"
	"2828961195"	"Just stay dead already!"
	"3751392573"	"I like you better than Zeus, but I'm still gonna kill ya."
	"1327933612"	"When are you lightning guys gonna realize you can't beat me."
	"941725754"	"I'm sending you back to the Seven Hells."
	"1491472863"	"Looks like you met your doom! Ok, I gotta workshop that, that was no good."
	"803283273"	"So you're the famous Dragon Knight? Disappointing."
	"3068686579"	"I fight gods, what chance did a half dragon have?"
	"3253682277"	"I own this jungle!"
	"1602999750"	"You never had a chance, Traxex."
	"680322384"	"I'll crack you in half!"
	"2978329834"	"You should've stayed in the ground Kaolin."
	"3330442364"	"So, you're the one who stole my story."
	"1446877677"	"Cute hammer, Earthshaker. Next time use it."
	"557492603"	"Your time is up, old man!"
	"1942700572"	"You never should've left your forge!"
	"80507530"	"Sorry buddy!"
	"2646942512"	"You picked the wrong side, Xin!"
	"3938587558"	"You seemed nice, sorry!"
	"1957070341"	"You should'vea stuck with singing to rabbits, fighting's not your thing."
	"60929683"	"The Dark Fundementals must die!"
	"2594760489"	"It ends here, Enigma!"
	"3987724223"	"I won't have the gods undo my glory!"
	"2098252334"	"Time's up!"
	"169343672"	"Woo! Smashing this thing made my day!"
	"1792045917"	"You're grounded!"
	"500646859"	"I grant you the death you crave Huskar!"
	"2229146225"	"Sacred Warrior. How pedestrian."
	"4091093735"	"Stop talking already!"
	"1841149764"	"You can't talk your way out this one, Invoker."
	"448432082"	"Two heads, and not a warrior between them."
	"2209601128"	"I was expecting a fight. How disappointing."
	"4105496318"	"Juggernaut, when I'm through with you there won't be any of your kind."
	"1678506863"	"Heroes don't hide behind masks."
	"319605753"	"Ezalor, you should have used that horse to run."
	"3980947346"	"You've had a good run Old Man, but it's my time now."
	"2588892932"	"You should have went down with your ship, pirate."
	"54922942"	"Try to keep up, Kunkka."
	"1950432808"	"Who put you in charge of a Legion?"
	"3928337291"	"I always heard the Bronze Legion was weak, and now I see why!"
	"2636290845"	"It's all over Leshrac!"
	"69978791"	"Begone Leshrac!"
	"3818121120"	"You're an abomination!"
	"2492782390"	"You were safer in that dungeon, Lifestealer."
	"4099104467"	"Your name's Lifesteale'? Man, this joke writes itself."
	"2203348549"	"Your sister was right about you, you are overrated."
	"442318847"	"I didn't want it to go this way Lina."
	"1834618729"	"You're finished Demon Witch!"
	"4080966346"	"I'll send you back to hell!"
	"2218371676"	"Wish you had friends now, huh Druid?"
	"489749478"	"No one rules nature, but me!"
	"1782041456"	"Your pet can't help you Luna!"
	"4203271905"	"You brought this on yourself!"
	"2375018103"	"I'll put you down like the dog you are."
	"3857079977"	"Your pack is finished, Lycan!"
	"2464247359"	"Speed beats strength everytime! Haha!"
	"199769989"	"Give it up Magnus, you can't catch me."
	"2096041747"	"Well, you and Zeus deserve each other"
	"3800799920"	"You're finished Medusa!"
	"2509023782"	"Bring as many copies as you want, you're all dead!"
	"210107292"	"It'll take more than 5 of you!"
	"2072169226"	"You're making this too easy Mirana."
	"3946698395"	"Goodbye Princess."
	"2621105677"	"No one out transforms me!"
	"4244467688"	"It ends here Morphling!"
	"2348441470"	"You've sang your last song, Siren!"
	"317918916"	"No one tries to control the Monkey King!"
	"1710505554"	"Pulling root was your ruin, Prophet."
	"4220562417"	"Trees offer no protection from me."
	"2358745959"	"You're done preying on the weak Necrophos!"
	"362728157"	"Going up against me, Necrophos? That's just masochistic."
	"1654258251"	"I've heard a lot of stories about you. I guess this is the last one."
	"4062635994"	"Mistake me for easy prey, Night Stalker? You're a fairy tale. And I'm a legend."
	"3620748331"	"No one tries to assassinate the Monkey King and lives!"
	"2698448061"	"Haha. You amused me, Ogres. Pity."
	"970874119"	"Twice the ogre? Try half the challenge."
	"1322872209"	"Sycophant!"
	"3502110770"	"Where's your Omniscience now?"
	"2814036132"	"Tell me you saw this coming."
	"1051957534"	"I'll trust my staff over your whispered dreams, Oracle."
	"1236576648"	"It's adorable. You think you can stop me."
	"3641422873"	"Hadn't you heard? Imprisoning me just makes me stronger."
	"2920055951"	"Didn't your sisters warn you about me, Assassin?"
	"3469413738"	"The Phantom Veil becomes your shroud, Mortred."
	"3117170172"	"Honestly, I don't see the resemblance."
	"549809222"	"That's my trick, ghost man. And I do it better."
	"1472355536"	"You were adorable before I killed you."
	"3383150963"	"Sorry, Puck. The battlefield's no place for you."
	"3198286309"	"You disgust me Pudge. Oh, not morally or anything, you're just gross."
	"665364575"	"Here, piggy, piggy!"
	"1353685193"	"You haven't earned anything, runt."
	"3222308184"	"The battlefield's no place for tantrums, Pugna."
	"3071784398"	"Back to hell, succubus. This kingdom needs no Queen."
	"2173344685"	"Your reign is over!"
	"4136479547"	"Your days of torment are over, Razor!"
	"1870985857"	"I'm not some rat in your maze."
	"411290135"	"I wish I could unsee you, Riki."
	"2263310260"	"Oh, sorry! Didn't see you."
	"4058017570"	"I don't steal spells, Rubick, I take lives."
	"1760116376"	"Grand Magus? Guess that was just another fairy tale."
	"535694862"	"Many claim the crown, Sand Thing, few bear the weight."
	"2404455327"	"King? Hardly."
	"4166394633"	"I've dealt with your puppets before. It's nice to kill the real thing."
	"2559683308"	"I'll always know which one is real, Shadow Demon."
	"4019624570"	"I won't let you claim another soul!"
	"1990183872"	"It's over Nevermore. You're finished!"
	"26803030"	"You're nothing a but a petty thug."
	"2684120821"	"I know a huckster when I see one."
	"3908787811"	"Oh, shut up."
	"1911689177"	"Had to kill you before you bored me to death."
	"116735823"	"From the greatest heights fall the biggest cowards."
	"2521440990"	"Are those things made of wax, Skywrath?"
	"3779924552"	"You're the ugliest thing I've seen, Slardar. And I've seen a lot."
	"3015506223"	"Not even the Siren could protect you."
	"3300641209"	"Couldn't escape that, could you?"
	"1571985411"	"Your sentence isn't life this time, Slark, it's death."
	"716548245"	"You think your toy levels the playing field?"
	"3033611574"	"That cowardly weapon has no place on my battlefield, Sniper."
	"3285585312"	"Enunciate!"
	"769158284"	"Stupid cow."
	"3177672989"	"Bara, you had all of existence to choose from, and you picked a fight with me? Idiot."
	"3395305867"	"You'll have to try harder than that Storm Spirit."
	"2863122542"	"Every storm eventually blows out, Raijin."
	"3718314232"	"I'm not saying there's always a connection between excessive braun and mental deficiency."
	"1151969602"	"Haha, Sven. You thought you could keep up with me? There are trees everywhere!"
	"867080660"	"No one likes you, Techies. Just go away."
	"2915699831"	"Saved you the trouble. Idiots."
	"3670883553"	"You should've stuck to the library, Lanaya."
	"1136946523"	"The Temple will have to find a new errand girl."
	"885218765"	"You do know that demon killing's kind of my thing, right?"
	"2759606364"	"Your name is more impressive than your actuall skills."
	"3548082378"	"I made a bet with Kunkka that I'd bag you first."
	"759157921"	"Sorry, Tidehunter, you'll have to settle for burial at river."
	"1513677879"	"Ever wondered if maybe your city had it comin', Rizzrack?"
	"3274814861"	"The trees have been saying some very bad things about you, Timbersaw."
	"3023471899"	"I have brains and braun, Tinker. "
	"710021304"	"I have respect for your ingenuity, Tinker. But I'm still crushing your skull."
	"1565859886"	"Only room in this lane for one stoney killer, Tiny."
	"3294392724"	"I get it. Your name's ironic. Good bye."
	"3009102082"	"The trees will be just fine without you."
	"602168467"	"I always wanted to take up woodcarving."
	"1424190469"	"You got spirit Warlord, I'll give you that."
	"874833376"	"Trolls. Always a challenge, never an obstacle."
	"1126421878"	"You threw your life away for a bet, Tusk? I like that."
	"3660219596"	"You wanted to fight in a war, Tusk? I give you war!"
	"2905453658"	"Get back in your pit, Underlord."
	"860430841"	"So much fanfare. So much dissapointment."
	"1145966959"	"You've forgotten your life. None will remember your death."
	"3712434389"	"He seemed to die just fine to me."
	"2856349763"	"Your kin are safe from me, Ursa. If they don't follow your mistake."
	"989818322"	"You chose the wrong friends, noble beast. "
	"1308122436"	"Return to your unquiet grave, spirit!"
	"3886080240"	"Come back for vengeance, and I'll do that again."
	"2426916966"	"You think you're the scariest thing in the Jungle?"
	"162431452"	"That's the biggest banana slug I've ever seen."
	"2125050186"	"Monkey vs snake. Monkey wins. Monkey always wins!"
	"3771540713"	"Let's see if your poison's good for cleaning off blood."
	"2546603135"	"You hold no sway over me, Visage."
	"247678405"	"I'm on no lists, Visage. Seek elsewhere."
	"2042918227"	"Men, demons, men with demons. Makes no difference to me."
	"3917179074"	"I've killed a thousand men like you, Warlock. I'll happily kill a thousand more."
	"2658949204"	"Not hard catching bugs when you use a stick."
	"4273721777"	"I'm reminded of a delicacy I tried in the Palace of Hurra'agdu. One of your brood, perhaps."
	"2310856999"	"Traxxex was right about you: you are a middling talent."
	"280342685"	"Congratulations, Windranger. You did get there first."
	"1739751435"	"Killed one kind of dragon, killed 'em all."
	"4191557032"	"You didn't do your homework, Wyvern."
	"400061572"	"And I'm taking your monkey friend with me."
	"1625244690"	"In which ditch should we bury you, doctor?"
	"4032846211"	"King? Ha!"
	"2271701269"	"Get back up again, I dare you."
	"3583410802"	"You should have turned yourself into swan and hid, you bastard."
	"2727457508"	"As a god, Zeus, you were lacking, but this?! "
	"999875422"	"Zeus? Never heard of him."
	"1285542856"	"You need to work on the fundamentals, Io."
	"3539682923"	"Look at that, a falling star!"
	"2784786173"	"Stay in the ashes, Phoenix."
	"1022699335"	"Oh, I hate birds."
	"4212437280"	"Quick question Abaddon: when you say 'Lord of Avernus' is that by birth or by marriage?"
	"1646125210"	"Hey Abaddon, I know you got the mist thing down, but can you make clouds?"
	"354078732"	"So you met in jail, huh? I was stuck in solitary."
	"2340308399"	"Listen Ogre, some financial advice? If that little man stiffs you out of any of your money, beat him to death."
	"4235818297"	"Listen ghost, if you're ever gonna ask the Crystal Maiden out on that date, you better start working on those ice puns."
	"1701848195"	"Here's the plan: you freeze 'em, and I'll smash their face in."
	"309793813"	"So when you say 'you'll bring an end to magic', you don't mean loveable talking monkey royalty right?"
	"2194147716"	"Anti-Mage you need to smile more."
	"4123998482"	"Alright it's just a suggestion: take it or leave it at your leisure. But maybe you should start talking in the first person."
	"2500374775"	"Arc Warden, you're not planning on sticking me in the moon or anything like that?"
	"3792666721"	"I think it's great you commissioned Goodkind to write about you.  I mean, people talk about me for free but - good for you."
	"2064044507"	"Axe, you and I are gonna hurt a whole lot of people."
	"201449805"	"Ya know, nightmare bringing aside, you're a pleasant guy to work with."
	"2456122606"	"You want a good nightmare to torment people? Have 'em trapped inside a rock. It's brutal."
	"3848422520"	"After the battle you mind if I take the bat for a spin?"
	"2087392706"	"So, how long have you and the bat been an item?"
	"191636820"	"You like animals. I am an animal. I think you and I are gonna get along just fine."
	"2614311109"	"Ditch the boar, my friend, primates are where it's at."
	"3973318739"	"Stick with me and you'll find all the blood you need."
	"3190154036"	"Bloodseeker, your work is messy but necessary."
	"3374502818"	"Try to keep up, Gondar!"
	"1345028632"	"Scarves are hard to pull off, but it really works on you Bounty Hunter."
	"657240718"	"Brewmaster, after we kill their ancient we are getting loaded."
	"3108513581"	"So how does one become a brewmaster? Is it hours as an apprentince, an accredited course, self given title."
	"3461289915"	"When this is all over you, me, and Brewmaster should just get loaded and pick some fights."
	"1464223233"	"Oh, I wish I could have seen that bar fight between you and Tusk."
	"541161111"	"Let's just get through this Arachnia."
	"2969463558"	"Would it kill you to walk around like how we first met?"
	"3355007888"	"Nice belt. What does it do?"
	"2805912181"	"Centaur, you should really climb a tree sometime, you don't know what you're missing"
	"3493454563"	"Me, you, and Phantom Lancer should start up an illusory exclusive club."
	"1227928409"	"Nice horse. "
	"1043825615"	"Just promise me you won't control me, ok Chen?"
	"2689799788"	"Ethically speaking, how are you ok with marching helpless creatures off to their demise?"
	"3612616442"	"Ya mind if I call you Bones? Because whenever I hear Clinkz I start looking for a clockwork creature 'n I get really confused."
	"1314748224"	"You're a hero Clinkz. Not enough people give you credit for that."
	"2850380359"	"You lock 'em down tin man, I'll take care of the rest"
	"3739380433"	"Hey Rylai, you think you could introduce me to Lina?"
	"3900654770"	"Alright Maiden, let's have some fun."
	"2675471396"	"You think too much Dark Seer. Try living by instinct sometimes."
	"108078494"	"A plan is a list of things that don't happen, Dark Seer. Live in the moment."
	"1903564040"	"Dazzle: you keep me alive and I'll keep knockin' em in the dirt."
	"4010967211"	"Alright Shadow priest, try to keep up!"
	"2551558205"	"Prophet, I get that it's your thing, but try not to die OK?"
	"18669959"	"Lady, you're creeping me out."
	"1981534481"	"Hey Disruptor: you're with me that Zeus is a jerk, right?"
	"2443443222"	"Doom, huh? Your mom musta loved you."
	"4049892851"	"So, Doom. The Seven Hells. That sounds cozy."
	"2254652773"	"Half dragon, my cloud's in the shop. Can I ride you into battle?"
	"527045855"	"Let me know when you turn into a dragon and kill everyone. I love that part."
	"1751983177"	"Hey Traxex, I don't know what that other archer was talking about, you're not an emotionally vacant husk of perpetual sadness."
	"4127830506"	"I don't want to stick my nose in Ranger business, but that redhead wasn't saying the most kind things about you."
	"2165211516"	"Just stay away from me, Kaolin."
	"403165382"	"Don't talk to me and we wont have any problems, Earth Spirit."
	"1862328400"	"What's up with the Earth trying to keep guys like us down?"
	"4290772417"	"We should start up an 'imprisoned in earth' support group."
	"2293812567"	"So, Elder Titan. You're really old."
	"3662226992"	"Alright, old man titan, watch and see how it's done."
	"2907575974"	"When this is over we're gonna have a chat about what you did."
	"877086492"	"You and your brothers are dead to me Xin."
	"1128298378"	"Not gonna lie, Enchantress: aside from Monkeys, I kind of hate animals."
	"3710181929"	"Enchantress, you are impossibly cheerful"
	"2854474431"	"Enigma, you are one scary force of nature."
	"858424069"	"Hey Enigma, remember when you tricked that Alchemist? Oh, ha! Good times."
	"1143845779"	"I think I liked you better as a dinosaur."
	"3566382594"	"Excuse me, Mr. Void - is the Monkey Kingdom bound by the Clazemere Treaty?"
	"2744491668"	"You are an annoying little man in an annoying little plane."
	"3276937073"	"I hate you Gyrocopter."
	"3025479655"	"You and Dazzle should really just have a drink and hug it out."
	"761034333"	"Huskar, I'm not trying to tell you how to live your life, but getting sacrificed is a bad thing."
	"1515931339"	"I know a thing or two about egomaniacs: and Invoker, you're one of the worst."
	"3292517224"	"We get it Invoker, you're smart. Now can we kill these guys?"
	"3006850046"	"Jakiro, Dragon Knight won't play ball: but you'll let me ride you, right?"
	"707899972"	"Glad you're on our side Jakiro."
	"1563853522"	"You gotta tell me what happened on the Isle of Masks."
	"3448348483"	"Juggernaut, is it true you and Templar Assassin used to be a thing?"
	"3129913301"	"You gotta show me how to do that lightshow trick Ezalor."
	"1154091966"	"Keeper, I was thinking next Thursday would be a good day for my 'fundamental ascension' ceremony, that work for you?"
	"869088040"	"Kunnka, I'm not trying to be rude but you got something on your forehead."
	"2864999058"	"Let's do this Kunkka."
	"3720567300"	"You realize you basically named your Legion 3rd place, right?"
	"1135071143"	"Tresdin, I don't care what armies you've lead: you don't tell me what to do."
	"882966321"	"Great. Another old guy that throws lighting around."
	"2913578635"	"Just try not to electrocute me, ok Leshrac?"
	"3668876829"	"Ya know for a mage that's cheated death you're personable."
	"1242661772"	"You don't really warm up to people much, do you Lich?"
	"1024897818"	"Lifestealer, is that a family name? Or more of an occupation, like haberdasher?"
	"1573993215"	"So, you were in prison a long time. Got any good stories?"
	"718670441"	"Hey Lina, after we win can I buy you a drink?"
	"3017759699"	"Soooo Lina. Your sister tell you about me?"
	"3302517573"	"Lion, your name is very misleading."
	"1522335462"	"So, Demon Witch, that's a helluva title."
	"767282800"	"So are you 'Lone Druid' because you're the last druid? Or because you hate hanging out with other Druids?"
	"3031605194"	"Sylla; you, me, and that bear of yours are gonna win this battle."
	"3283464028"	"Hey Luna, nice wolf."
	"1393210061"	"We should go on a moonlit walk sometime.  You know, after we kill a whole lot of people."
	"604865115"	"Lycan, you gotta step up your transformation game."
	"3617042478"	"I'll help you reclaim Ambry, Lycan."
	"2693824696"	"You are a large man, Magnus."
	"966381826"	"Hey Magnus, I want to start up a conservation group, you in?"
	"1319035284"	"I saw you and Zeus at the Sundered Moon the other night, he's married you know."
	"3506074679"	"So, does your hair ever get tangles? Or does it always just look good?"
	"2818393249"	"You're underrated Meepo."
	"1056183579"	"Guys like us gotta stick together Meepo."
	"3645650972"	"I summered in Nightsilver before. Lovely trees."
	"2924152970"	"Try not to get me wet, Morphling."
	"3465314671"	"Morphling, you are a lot more intimidating in person than your name suggests."
	"3112940025"	"You got a helluva voice Siren."
	"545448003"	"The Deep Ones are lucky to have you on their side."
	"1468387541"	"Just don't go moving the trees when I need 'em, Prophet."
	"3386983798"	"Forcing trees to fight goes against their nature, Prophet."
	"3202774496"	"Ugh! Cover your mouth when you cough, Necrophos. You disgust me."
	"669983834"	"Don't steal my kills and we'll get along just fine."
	"1357386956"	"I guess you're not useless half the time, Night Stalker. That's pretty good."
	"3226929501"	"Do we really have to wait til night to start fighting?"
	"3075488203"	"Who invited the zealot?"
	"3852587692"	"Nyx, I don't wanna see you this battle"
	"2460410426"	"So, do both heads need to eat?"
	"196064128"	"You're lucky you know, one of you can focus on the battle and the other can watch me be fantastic."
	"2091418390"	"You've taken the power, Omniknight. It's yours. Stop kowtowing."
	"3805025973"	"Your powers may be real, but I've never seen this Omniscience."
	"2513118755"	"Never tell me the odds."
	"214071193"	"I can see the future, too, Oracle. It looks like victory."
	"2076526351"	"Just so you know, I have a strict no-astral-imprisonment policy."
	"3950664350"	"Stop looking at me like that."
	"2625464840"	"Just admit it, Phantom Assassin, you kill because you like it. "
	"4240106477"	"I'm not one of the 5 names on the list right?"
	"2344473467"	"You're a handsome fellow!"
	"313819841"	"It's quite the honor to be mistaken for me"
	"1706275415"	"Where is that Undertree, Puck? I might like to climb it."
	"4225181684"	"You should become my plucky sidesick, Puck."
	"2362447714"	"Old friend! Oh. Thought you were someone else."
	"366560984"	"Do me a favor and try not to get puss on me."
	"1658746446"	"Strange bedfellows, huh Pugna?"
	"4066470879"	"No, I don't want to see your nether ward. Stop asking."
	"2238077769"	"Sorry Akasha, I'm not looking for a Queen."
	"3019601194"	"You and Osterion would make a helluva power couple."
	"3304867260"	"For someone without a discernable face, Razor, you sure look smug."
	"1576342534"	"Be careful Razor, one day that whip will be turned on you."
	"720512144"	"Didn't think I'd be seeing you here, Riki."
	"3029774643"	"I'm friends with an alarming amount of assassins."
	"3281093029"	"How about a friendly duel, Rubick? I've heard some things."
	"1519964191"	"Us tricksters need to stick together, eh, Rubick?"
	"765452425"	"Fighting by your side goes against every instinct I have."
	"3173055768"	"I know a fellow you should talk to, Sand King. Fast friends, the two of you."
	"3391606158"	"A demon watching my back. There's a first time for everything."
	"2866824299"	"I'm something of a demon myself, you know."
	"3722933501"	"Keep your hands off my soul and we'll get along just fine."
	"1156457799"	"I'm not afraid to name you friend, Shadow Fiend."
	"870913489"	"I'm a fan of your work Shaman, a good con is a thing of beauty."
	"2911731826"	"Are your grifting days all behind you, Shadow Shaman?"
	"3666522340"	"I'll do the talking, Silencer."
	"1132716382"	"Your voice really carries, Silencer. A bit too much."
	"881119688"	"Are all birdmen this morose? Just you?"
	"2755382361"	"Know your problem?  Too subservient. Be your own birdman for once."
	"3543989455"	"You're the ugliest thing I've ever seen, Slardar. No offense."
	"2177701800"	"I think I like hanging out with Siren better."
	"4140443454"	"You get inked in Dark Reef?"
	"1875080836"	"They don't know what it's like inside. Right, Slark?"
	"415516178"	"Careful not to shoot me in the back, Sniper."
	"2258686897"	"Just stay away from my kills, Sniper."
	"4054311719"	"If you need help, Spectre, just shout unintelligibly. "
	"1756279453"	"We gotta work on your communication skills Spectre."
	"531202571"	"Don't go running off without me, Spirit Breaker."
	"2400624538"	"You're almost crazier than I am, Spirit Breaker."
	"4161908492"	"I've seen Xin and Kaolin. Where's your other brother?"
	"2564171497"	"Just make me a damn cloud."
	"4023457407"	"How do you see anything with that helmet on, Sven?"
	"1993885637"	"Come on, Sven. Time to drop the hammer on someone!"
	"31422291"	"Wanna spring some traps, Techies?"
	"2679890672"	"I'll line 'em up, Techies. You'll know when to press the button."
	"3904688742"	"What happened with you and Juggernaut?"
	"1907721180"	"Thought all this Ancients business was beneath you, Lanaya."
	"112374602"	"Why do you spend so much time in your lesser form, Terrorblade?"
	"2517479131"	"I've seen my fair share of demonic brotherhoods. They might have considered you."
	"3775569485"	"Just watch it with the splashing, Tidehunter."
	"525220390"	"Just jump in there and do your thing, Tidehunter. I'm right behind you."
	"1749617328"	"We talked about this, Timbersaw. No clearcutting!"
	"4047526666"	"If I can't leap to the fight, Timbersaw, you know who to blame. "
	"2252827548"	"So Tinker, was it head trauma that made you dream all that up?"
	"405012031"	"I can appreciate a man unconstrained by what the world tells him's possible."
	"1864683177"	"So Tiny's just a not-so-clever name then."
	"4130184979"	"We've actually got something in common, Tiny. What kind of stone are you?"
	"2167058309"	"The trees respect you, Treant, but they love me."
	"295023124"	"Yes, yes, Treant. I remember. No climbing. "
	"1720877698"	"I didn't think you went in for team sports, Troll."
	"106236775"	"My friend Breklin is a big fan of your work, Warlord."
	"1901214705"	"Tusk! I like a fellow who does what he says and says what he does."
	"3898305099"	"So, Tusk. What can you tell me about Rylai?"
	"2673629917"	"Where we going today, Underlord?"
	"20500350"	"What's the worst place you've accidentally rifted to?"
	"1983905768"	"I think there are better ways to do it, Undying, but to each his own."
	"4013338194"	"Undying? Yeah, me too."
	"2553388740"	"Ursa! I welcome you to my fight."
	"143557461"	"The world needs more bears like you, Ursa."
	"2139730883"	"I'm with you - I like making people pay for what they did too."
	"3587247735"	"I like a lady that goes after what she wants."
	"2731949793"	"You should visit my Kingdom sometime."
	"1004498779"	"Just try not to spit on me, ok?"
	"1289248717"	"You're not exciting, Viper, but you sure get the job done."
	"3535587950"	"You're Viper? Don't look like one to me."
	"2780560120"	"Send your birds aloft, Visage. Let's find some prey."
	"1018342210"	"Don't have to worry about me, Visage. I won't be traversing the Narrow Maze."
	"1270193108"	"Can I borrow that book when you're done with it, Warlock?"
	"3674900037"	"I always did enjoy a good demon story."
	"2886579923"	"No hard feelings, right, Weaver?"
	"3435806518"	"Weaver, don't let the bastards keep you down."
	"3150778272"	"You don't fool me, Lyralei. I see the killer behind that smile."
	"583294490"	"I don't know what Traxex was talking about, you're not completely useless at all."
	"1438871180"	"Tell me, Wyvern, which story about me is your favorite?"
	"3416783663"	"Wyvern, my life is poetry."
	"3164654521"	"I like your style, Witch Doctor."
	"631872003"	"What's in that cask, anyway, Witch Doctor? "
	"1387178645"	"We might as well make the best of it, Ostarion."
	"3255940868"	"I'll fight beside you, but I'm not callin' you king, Wraith."
	"3038152594"	"It's no secret I don't like you, Zeus. Well, it isn't a secret now. That didn't go as planned."
	"3890703605"	"It's ok, Zeus. You're one of the good ones. Today."
	"2430622819"	"Not much of a conversationalist, eh, Io?"
	"166268377"	"Don't take this the wrong way, Phoenix, but if one of us has to die, I'd rather it be you."
	"202969449"	"Shitty wizard!"
	"3406538007"	"Crummy wizard!"
	"276215941"	"Haaa."
	"4269332905"	"Haaaa."
