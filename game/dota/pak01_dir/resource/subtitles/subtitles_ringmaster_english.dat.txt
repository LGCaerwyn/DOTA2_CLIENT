"
	"3204206141"	"Your graphics card falls below our official minimum specs,
which have not been changed in the transition to Dota 2 Reborn.
When running under the Source 1 engine, that did not prevent
the game from working because the engine was not designed around
the full capabilities of the minimum spec for graphic cards.
However, Dota 2 Reborn relies on graphics features such as vertex textures and shader model 3.0
and so adherence to the minimum spec is a stronger requirement
than it was in Source 1 Dota 2. Unfortunately this means that Dota 2 Reborn
will not be able to run on some graphics cards from 2006 or before.

	"1438971772"	"It's all part of the show!"

	"2541562025"	"Sit back and watch."
	"130168120"	"I'm not broken yet, but you'll be."
	"1891960238"	"I'm not done with auditions."
	"268602443"	"We can both die on stage!"
	"2826750110"	"Time to break a leg. Time to break all the legs."
	"829790500"	"All right, everyone, remember your cues."
	"1181919666"	"It's time. Play the music. Light the lights!"
	"3625335825"	"Raise the curtain -- it's time to put on a show."
	"2937130119"	"Remember -- if you forget your lines, I'll kill you."
	"907566397"	"Iiiiiit's showtime!"
	"1092578731"	"The show is on the road!"
	"3516952634"	"Let's go break some legs out there."
	"2795978924"	"Time to cut a smile on some faces!"
	"766403254"	"Blink Dagger"
	"3030856460"	"Now you see me..."
	"3282043802"	"Faster than the eye can see, move clever than the mind dares contemplate."
	"4229887477"	"We'll put on quite a show."
	"1696048207"	"For the afterparty."
	"303076569"	"Strange times, indeed."
	"2356412794"	"How do they fit?"
	"4218630636"	"In case the audience gets unruly."
	"1652187222"	"Oh is this for me?"
	"2994465752"	"Bounty."
	"728939106"	"Better than an ace note -- this thing's solid gold."
	"1551207156"	"I'll keep the lion tamer's share."
	"768139577"	"Hands off the talent."
	"3032592515"	"That one's under contract."
	"3284566037"	"Get off the stage!"
	"1570903478"	"Almost missed my cue."
	"715466016"	"I told you not to step on my lines."
	"3014423706"	"Costume change."
	"3299558412"	"A star in the making. If they survive."
	"1410619805"	"Mind the stabby bits."
	"588474635"	"That one belongs to me."
	"1138024686"	"Oh no you don't."
	"886296696"	"Get the hook."
	"2916778434"	"Watching closely?"
	"452616680"	"I don't use carrots -- only sticks."
	"2213752914"	"I've been saving this one."
	"4109631684"	"Time for a crowdpleaser."
	"1787860327"	"Would it kill you to smile?"
	"496477681"	"And for my next trick..."
	"2225009739"	"Watch very closely now!"
	"4086940893"	"My audiences simply DIE for this one!"
	"1663490380"	"Hold your applause!"
	"337766874"	"The magic of the stage!"
	"1961254975"	"Another showstopper!"
	"65097897"	"A little slight of hand and..."
	"2598895891"	"I've got just the trick for you."
	"3991875973"	"I love a captive audience. "
	"1938531366"	"No refunds!"
	"3141816446"	"Just a few more tricks."
	"575472068"	"No bowing out."
	"1430925650"	"I'll take 5 after this."
	"3408831729"	"The show isn't over!"
	"2747997507"	"Crummy wizard."
	"2867825730"	"I told you we should have rehearsed..."
	"870768120"	"Just an artist... unappreciated in his own time..."
	"1155657070"	"And now...a brief intermission..."
	"3666180301"	"That's just part...of live entertainment."
	"2910996571"	"Life's...a circus."
	"881531361"	"So that's how...this act ends..."
	"1133259127"	"I'm sorry -- that area's off limits to spectators."
	"3543348454"	"That's it... Fold the show."
	"2754872432"	"Everyone's a critic!"
	"3304295829"	"Exit, stage death!"
	"3019160835"	"To the scrap heap!"
	"721284281"	"Not even a curtain call!"
	"1576721455"	"But I'm not done yet!"
	"3281930636"	"My gears are... (slowing to nothing)"
	"3029956890"	"My master was right!"
	"764422304"	"Is this my final performance?"
	"1519851574"	"Cancelled in my prime!"
	"3391620519"	"And that's our show!"
	"3173987633"	"I...quit."
	"4024360534"	"Throw me on...the scrap heap."
	"198459259"	"What's in the box? Me!"
	"2463985345"	"Dress rehearsal is over -- now it's showtime."
	"3856293463"	"I assure you, friends, I was in no danger at all. But you are."
	"2076101620"	"Welcome, welcome -- to the very last performance you'll ever see."
	"213515106"	"Good evening, gentle gallery. Tonight's show is, simply put, to die for."
	"2511383256"	"I'm sorry to keep you all waiting."
	"3803683406"	"You won't believe your eyes!"
	"1913161695"	"Take your seat. The show's about to begin"
	"84916041"	"Try your luck with me!"
	"1707622060"	"The rampage of a lifetime awaits!"
	"315559482"	"The talent has arrived!"
	"2345033600"	"All the world's a stage of pain. And I'm the director."
	"4240535318"	"When do I meet my co-stars?"
	"3662707978"	"Nobody likes when a show starts late."
	"1129917616"	"Are we EVER getting this show on the road?"
	"878582822"	"I'm late for my cue."
	"2855963013"	"Either buy a ticket or step away from the box office."
	"785815198"	"Denied."
	"806754373"	"Denied."
	"3084896036"	"Denied!"
	"3235444658"	"Now that, my friend, was a deny."
	"1589404177"	"I know a clown when I see one."
	"700142215"	"Stunned silence, I see."
	"2964456253"	"What are you just standing there for?"
	"3350541227"	"You can do better."
	"1460284986"	"Did I step on your line?"
	"537730732"	"Stop me if you've heard this one."
	"1087018825"	"Spare me."
	"936224735"	"No freebies."
	"2932143717"	"Level up, buttercup."
	"3653486323"	"Uh-uh-uh."
	"1545217916"	"Denied."
	"3306387142"	"No."
	"2987673168"	"Next."
	"745591795"	"Don't waste my time."
	"1534583653"	"Nice try, bumpkin."
	"3263083231"	"Amateur."
	"3044639305"	"I'm sure it stings."
	"633774040"	"You'll get over it."
	"1388425038"	"Oh please..."
	"839263915"	"What's your excuse?"
	"63064864"	"Double damage."
	"2597001882"	"We'll knock 'em dead."
	"3989580300"	"Commence with the leg breaking."
	"4210767315"	"I've seen that one before."
	"2501236097"	"This might do."
	"3474463722"	"Well what have we here?"
	"1443973712"	"I'm speechless."
	"213076753"	"Once more, with feeling."
	"2512001707"	"Take it again -- from the top."
	"3318068529"	"Ahh, First blood!"
	"1556931723"	"First blood! The most amazing, the most astounding murder of all time."
	"734778397"	"First blood. I hope you didn't blink. You'll never see its likes again."
	"3048161726"	"First blood, best blood."
	"3265818920"	"First blood. Curtains up for us -- but yes, down for you."
	"1537286290"	"First blood. Gone too soon. Oh well, on with the show."
	"749080580"	"First blood. I AM the master of ceremonies after all!"
	"3155758485"	"First blood. A good Ringmaster always sets the tone."
	"3407756547"	"First blood. And the first ovation goes to ME."
	"2883171558"	"First blood. Now everyone's REALLY watching!"
	"3701537306"	"Ha haa"
	"1168747424"	"Oh ho ho"
	"850303798"	"Ahhh"
	"2898923157"	"Ohhh ho ho ho hoo"
	"3687661059"	"Ahh ha ha haa hooo"
	"1120169913"	"Ah ho ho ho"
	"3044787795"	"Haste"
	"745707497"	"My gears are whirling."
	"1534437247"	"Double time."
	"2727622320"	"Offend one and you offend us all."
	"1000171274"	"A master for each ring."
	"1285183388"	"Hello handsome."
	"3539911231"	"Illusion"
	"2420923913"	"Immortality!"
	"155520947"	"Now we can put on two shows."
	"2118270757"	"Just try and stop me."

	"1959091544"	"Don't worry. I never miss."
	"63073742"	"Oh, we do this trick differently in my show."
	"2644965485"	"This isn't butchery, it's art."
	"3936471291"	"Now where did I put that apple?"
	"1940429121"	"Where will they go? Only I know."
	"78621143"	"The knives are sharp, the tears are real."
	"2484122694"	"Catch."
	"3809969360"	"You forgot this."
	"2211450165"	"And one for you."
	"4107746723"	"I can do it with my eyes closed."
	"1843293209"	"The knives are real. The trick is that it's not a trick."
	"450452623"	"Oh you can't leave now."
	"2227030316"	"You're going to miss the best part."
	"4089117114"	"Hey, look over here."

	"844528871"	"Invisibility"
	"2875141469"	"But what about my smiling face?"

	"2215051816"	"We'll use them in the pit."
	"4076876478"	"If we can see it, we can kill it. Seems pretty simple to me."

	"68510419"	"Magic almost takes the fun out of it."
	"2635871081"	"I'm not in it for the money -- but I'll still take it."
	"3927639039"	"Is that a bottle of paint?"

	"3258000974"	"No. I don't think so."
	"3040220888"	"This isn't some county fair."
	"742344546"	"Perfectly educational for you, and adequately entertaining for me."
	"1530427380"	"This is quite possibly the biggest thing that has ever happened to you."
	"3414649445"	"That one didn't have a ticket."

	"4027008204"	"Big finale!"
	"2264953946"	"Now this is a grind show!"
	"3791335325"	"Mine."
	"2029157927"	"I'll take that."
	"267734705"	"The price of admission."
	"2442255122"	"No refunds."

	"2141174334"	"Your coins purloined."

	"3936438682"	"Next stop, stardom!"
	"2644932876"	"Standing ovation!"
	"78588086"	"I'm hitting the big time!"

	"2597043477"	"The crowds just adore me!"
	"63106223"	"I just came up with a new act!"
	"1959124025"	"My master would be so horrified. Or filled with envy. I love it!"
	"3833250216"	"Good art SHOULD be rewarded!"
	"2474504510"	"The reviews are in and I'm a hit!"
	"3247184473"	"Some of us were born to be stars. Others were made."
	"1042104459"	"No no no no no! That's not how we rehearesed!"
	"2803110193"	"Do you see what I have to work with?"
	"3490914727"	"Why do I even bother?"
	"1316467716"	"My life's work in pieces -- for this?"
	"963675282"	"I hate it I hate it I hate it."
	"2692338984"	"My fault? I'm not the one who missed my cue."
	"3615417790"	"Why do I even try?"
	"3751526513"	"A lovely little lotus all for me."
	"1184010699"	"A flower so fragrant it flourishes on my lapel."
	"831889757"	"I love to stop and smell a lotus."
	"2951820542"	"Don't mind me."
	"3640001640"	"A flower by any other name...would be useless."
	"2320333177"	"Top is missing."
	"578845483"	"Top is missing."
	"323233987"	"Middle is missing."
	"808834245"	"Middle is missing."
	"1682118741"	"Bottom is missing."
	"2290725792"	"Bottom is missing."
	"4128791003"	"You see me at the start of my story. Here is my beginning -- but I have no wish to stay here."
	"1863387233"	"The fame and fortune for which I was destined -- made, if we're to be crude about it -- has so far eluded me."
	"404109559"	"My adoring public insists on missing out. My mistake was waiting for my public to come to me."
	"1093108658"	"I must go out and find my audience, and bring them here, and make them watch."
	"3836606005"	"Show business has a broad spectrum of dignity..."
	"2107942799"	"From the exhibition of a dancing monkey to the entrancing of empires, securing for a gifted showman like myself a fame which princes may envy."
	"178493209"	"My career is currently more in the monkey exhibition end of the spectrum than empire entrancement."
	"4004187276"	"But baby steps."
	"3306733802"	"I'm just the simple proprietor of a simple circus."
	"2988437628"	"And despite what they say, it's not dangerous to ANYONE."
	"746284511"	"Look! Look at all my clowns and acrobats and fantastical beasts -- with such big smiles on their faces!"
	"1534874953"	"See their tears of pure delight."
	"3262448883"	"I'm always holding auditions for my next performer."
	"3044160613"	"What do you think? Do you have what it takes? To be a star?"
	"3251022313"	"Oh, but I'm bored with the trade of a traveling showman. "
	"1490024531"	"The capturing of creatures, the torturing of same, the eventual capering they perform under threat of still more torture..."
	"801687749"	"Am I good at it? Yes. Gods yes. "
	"2980863334"	"But I think I have more to give the world. "
	"902258387"	"Someday I could torture kings."
	"2038091404"	"My creator was a master craftsman, you know...Before the bottle took him."
	"3765673782"	"With naught but a block of wood or an ingot of iron, he could make small miracles."
	"2541006752"	"A toy here for a crying girl, a pocket watch there for the ringer of an old church bell."
	"152058371"	"But small miracles are never enough, are they? There's always MORE humans want."
	"2115439253"	"For his part, my master wanted a legacy. He wanted fame."
	"3877526319"	"He wanted to show the entire world the wonders he could conjure with simple tools and his bare hands."
	"2417585081"	"And for a time, he used me to chase that... dream."
	"10909224"	"Sadly, even for a miracle maker, dreams don't always come true."
	"2007058110"	"Eventually... Well, let's just say that his star faded. And I had to branch out on my own."
	"392613723"	"I'll always remember his last words to me -- "
	"1617035213"	"Gyaaa---ahahahah!"
	"4184387191"	"I couldn't have said it better myself."
	"366982824"	"So dramatic to the very end."
	"2282262033"	"With that, let me assure you, gentle patrons."
	"817162612"	"Tonight's show offers far more than your mere money's worth."
	"4261767790"	"This clockwork marvel didn't fall at all far from his maker's brilliant bench."
	"1351271503"	"Step to it."
	"3380844021"	"Wind me up..."
	"3196364131"	"Let me go."
	"551563456"	"Places, people."
	"1474756694"	"Step right up."
	"3471725036"	"Who asked you?"
	"3119079802"	"I think I can handle it."
	"693533931"	"I'M the leader of this show."
	"1582386301"	"Scouting locations?"
	"1050068376"	"Perfect!"
	"1234302222"	"Nothing would please me more."
	"3499664564"	"Just because I say."
	"2812253218"	"Proper blocking is paramount."
	"972751233"	"What, no advance?"
	"1325150487"	"What's the ballyhoo?"
	"3826244562"	"What is the ballyhoo?"
	"3623182509"	"Itchy feet?"
	"2700234811"	"One gear in front of the other."
	"810372522"	"Bump ba dump ba da da dee dump, ba dump ba dump be do do"

	"2360526817"	"My master should've built me with wheels."
	"1708221140"	"Getting in gear."

	"3917029050"	"Coming soon to a village near you."
	"211855130"	"Who wants to be my next audition?"
	"2074580876"	"Like a real boy. Ha."
	"3803104822"	"Yes, yes."
	"2510943904"	"There."
	"198009603"	"My pleasure."
	"1569797392"	"I hate losing parts."

	"771473823"	"I need an understudy."
	"1526526217"	"I hate road gigs."
	"3287654579"	"Just a few more tricks..."
	"3035795493"	"Should've stolen a little keen car."
	"609062324"	"Yes..."

	"3657963022"	"Wait your turn."
	"2903451288"	"I said wait!"
	"862696251"	"Not ready."
	"1147962285"	"Not. Ready."
	"3714437655"	"It's not ready!"
	"2858607233"	"No no. Not yet."
	"987627280"	"Not yet."
	"1306185606"	"Not yet!"
	"756893283"	"Hold your horses."
	"1511683829"	"Restrain yourself."
	"3272812367"	"Stop asking that!"
	"3021215705"	"We're closed."
	"712016506"	"Not now."
	"1568125676"	"Shut up!"
	"956811854"	"A brief residency, I assure you."
	"2685311988"	"Fine. Set up the tents."
	"3607735138"	"The foot traffic could be worse."
	"1231896257"	"What, here? This is a terrible place."
	"1047137879"	"Does anyone even live around here?"
	"1496899427"	"Ugh"
	"3224473305"	"Urgh"
	"3073818191"	"Oh"
	"693251052"	"Ah"
	"1582635898"	"Ahh"
	"3344714432"	"Agh"
	"2958785110"	"Ohh"
	"1648497914"	"Chop chop."
	"4216014144"	"Snap to, I haven't got all day."
	"2353821142"	"Are you in charge of props?"
	"304668789"	"Looking for work? I don't pay well, but you could see the world."
	"1697632483"	"We'll make it work."
	"3196696093"	"Regeneration."
	"662759335"	"Like a new coat of paint."
	"1351079729"	"I wasn't sure this would work for me."
	"3057918985"	"The show simply must go on."
	"793605555"	"I only play dead."
	"1481262373"	"I thought it was curtains."
	"3324956806"	"That's why we rehearse."
	"2972311568"	"Nothing for it really, my audience needs me."
	"673231274"	"Let them laugh. Ha! I know how this show ends."
	"1596424508"	"There's one born every minute..."
	"3482885293"	"Well that was a neat trick."
	"3097472059"	"A star is re-born!"
	"3629655518"	"Don't worry, it's all part of the act!"
	"2942244168"	"Back by popular demand!"
	"911623410"	"Back to one!"
	"1095857252"	"Like clockwork."
	"3744850375"	"They'll never find my killswitch."
	"2821902673"	"Time for an encore!"
	"825983211"	"That was just a dress rehearsal."
	"1178382461"	"The torture has just begun!"
	"3598953964"	"My run's been extended!"
	"2385029338"	"Your mists were obscuring my limelight."
	"388102496"	"I don't deal with horse operas. Just not a good fit."
	"1613154806"	"Do you have a silly little potion for that? Didn't think so."
	"4265761877"	"Engineering always beats chemistry."
	"2303028419"	"What a shame. Half of them looked useful."
	"273431929"	"I'm going to sell so many snow cones!"
	"1732972015"	"No blood? No viscera? Such a disappointment."
	"4159967358"	"You can't counter a clock, wiseapple!"
	"2163417320"	"And now you're Anti-Living!"
	"3761547533"	"Monks are best when they're silent."
	"2536741275"	"I don't do two for one sales!"
	"238733345"	"I honestly expected there would be fish inside that bowl."
	"2034104503"	"Maybe this will stop all that shaking."
	"3881397524"	"All the world's a stage. Except where you are. It's a cemetery."
	"2422103426"	"I could always use another strongman."
	"156699704"	"You'll be useful once I break you of that shouting."
	"2119187630"	"I think you have something in your teeth."
	"2582122921"	"Always leave them smiling!"
	"3407477454"	"I'm tired of your feats of aerial derring-do."
	"3156134488"	"I'll charge for bat rides."
	"622304226"	"I'm leaving the rider and taking the bat."
	"1376824180"	"Finally, we see who the true master is."
	"3430170327"	"Your little pets will be perfect in my show."
	"3144879681"	"Someone needs to go back to beast school."
	"578445307"	"You came looking for blood in the wrong place."
	"1434283885"	"You're going to make my show a scream!"
	"3317854972"	"You'll be my angriest attraction yet!"
	"2999272042"	"You have to be a better hunter to get the bounty."
	"3523398543"	"Did one of Kettle's debtors put a bounty on me?"
	"2768632601"	"You're getting chained to my beer tent."
	"1007463075"	"Cut back on the beer, focus on the fighting."
	"1259051573"	"I think you got mucous in my gears."
	"3580825494"	"Just stay away from my balloons!"
	"2724740864"	"Does anyone have a newspaper and broom?"
	"996241082"	"I almost miss the days when Kettle would clear out the cobwebs."
	"1281777196"	"You forgot about your natural weakness -- clown shoes."
	"3705226173"	"You were a one-trick pony, and that one trick was getting killed."
	"2883482411"	"You couldn't even earn a nickle in the sideshow carousel."
	"2638437704"	"You can lead a horse to water. Then you can kill him."
	"3930353118"	"I'm going to use your head as a popcorn maker!"
	"1934441572"	"Exit, stage left."
	"71961842"	"Nighty night, Chaos."
	"2586745169"	"Style! Pizzazz! Charisma! You had NONE of those!"
	"3978930631"	"Like a puppet on a string. Well, a noose."
	"1948317821"	"The heartburn was going to kill him anyway."
	"52938987"	"Just awful craftsmanship."
	"2476266874"	"You were a shining example -- of shoddy workmanship."
	"3835684332"	"Is..is that flesh and bone? Imposter!"
	"2220387337"	"Enjoy the chilling embrace...of death."
	"4083113119"	"Sorry to melt your chances at stardom."
	"1784024357"	"I bet you'd look terrible in a hat. Or perhaps much much better."
	"491863475"	"I don't need another 'mystic' act."
	"2201331728"	"A part of me wishes I'd kept you as a pet."
	"4096956550"	"Sorry. Fairies only live if the audience claps."
	"1832634684"	"Lights out!"
	"440203690"	"Dawn has broken. And so have you."
	"2323899451"	"She's bright, but not THAT bright."
	"4253340845"	"At least you went out smiling, Dazzle!"
	"2943696842"	"You were a terrible clown and a worse opponent."
	"3631353692"	"I prefer my death spelled P-R-O-F-I-T."
	"1098604262"	"Having a soul seems so messy."
	"914124400"	"Nobody disrupts MY show!"
	"2820209619"	"Your body is going to light up the big top!"
	"3743402821"	"Back to your piddling little hell."
	"1175886591"	"Father issues? I can relate."
	"823241321"	"Knight? Dragon? It hardly matters now. You're worm food."
	"2712582136"	"Nighty night, Dragon."
	"3601434478"	"Poor Slyrak. You're mostly just a man now. Something to be laughed at."
	"3060665995"	"I have just the sideshow for your skills."
	"3244899869"	"Step right up and lay right down in your shallow grave!"
	"1482715047"	"Drow are always so humorless. It's depressing."
	"795303729"	"I saw right through your pathetic I'm a drow act."
	"2969815698"	"I'll leave it to you to make your own headstone."
	"3322214916"	"I'm a stone's throw from victory."
	"1594731454"	"Ashes to ashes, dirt to dirt."
	"671783720"	"I'm really more into movers than shakers."
	"3098904249"	"Back to the ground whence you came, beast."
	"3484595759"	"Like a ram to the slaughter."
	"838210116"	"I guess that 'elder' part doesn't mean much. Unless you just meant old?"
	"1190208210"	"A pitiful fire snuffed out."
	"3757601640"	"No need to send a sizzle reel. I'll be in touch."
	"2835301374"	"Ahhh nature. I hate it."
	"916182621"	"Your paltry 'enchantments' hold no sway over me."
	"1100801739"	"That was a simple enough riddle to solve."
	"3633690481"	"Faceless Void where prohibited."
	"2945615847"	"There's no business like show business, except for the killing business."
	"1059953270"	"If it's any consolation, you were a bad artist anyway."
	"1210755808"	"I'd call your act a brush...with death."
	"686629637"	"Your painting style was pedestrian."
	"1609175955"	"No safety net to catch you."
	"3336782377"	"Now I can strip it for parts. Not the machine. The pilot."
	"2984538815"	"People will pay top gold to ride this copter. "
	"796976924"	"What a death scene! If you'd been acting, that would have been award-worthy!"
	"1485297546"	"You're going right into the petting zoo."
	"3247343152"	"I'll add rodent exterminator to my list of accolades."
	"3062478502"	"Oh, my audience will love seeing you in a cage."
	"641116983"	"If I had a heart, seeing so much blood would do it good."
	"1362205601"	"Aww, is someone feeling blue?"
	"4176343675"	"Spilling your own blood takes some of the sport out of it... But I don't mind."
	"2414527213"	"Tiresome little gnat."
	"384013143"	"I'm keeping the glowy parts."
	"1642374081"	"Bury yourself."
	"4286592610"	"It's a shame to kill such a good juggler."
	"2290550516"	"Excellent color sense, terrible personality."
	"294541134"	"You had balls coming after me."
	"1720281048"	"It appears two heads are in fact worse than one."
	"4130765385"	"A two for one ticket to the afterlife!"
	"2167491295"	"It's difficult to decide which of you I enjoyed killing more."
	"3791045434"	"I almost feel remorse at rendering your species extinct."
	"2532438956"	"Last of your kind. If I had time, I'd have you stuffed."
	"267952662"	"I think I'll keep the light if you don't mind."
	"2030015104"	"Sad old men all remind me too much of my master."
	"3868919587"	"Live by the sword, die by the Ringmaster."
	"2442934197"	"I'm not looking for a water act."
	"144008719"	"What do you do with a drunken sailor? Personally, I like killing them."
	"2140296857"	"What you fools never remember is: X also marks the dead."
	"4012722952"	"Now we see who was REALLY in command."
	"2552920990"	"One-woman army, meet one-woman funeral."
	"3403387129"	"An entire side show in just one monster."
	"3185352815"	"Being around you makes me ill. And I don't even have a stomach."
	"618000853"	"I know what it's like being controlled. You know what it's like being dead."
	"1406320963"	"You were already just bones, so this feels like a half-victory."
	"3451278560"	"Love the name, hate the face. That's a face for stage crew."
	"3132187766"	"Disgusting, I think I got some of you on me."
	"599274956"	"It was considerate of you to start decomposing before I killed you."
	"1421804890"	"Most fires eventually burn themselves out."
	"3288340683"	"Too bad. I was just getting warmed up."
	"3003590749"	"I've tamed tougher lions than you!"
	"3552616888"	"The smart ones are always so dumb."
	"2764542254"	"I could've tamed you faster if I had a wooden chair."
	"3568133537"	"Good night, moon."
	"2745849143"	"You've been eclipsed. But I get you're used to that."
	"983762061"	"You'll be perfect for the midnight show."
	"2853968156"	"I'm going to need a great taxidermist."
	"2625714047"	"Magnificent beast to look at. Not much for fighting, alas."
	"3951429609"	"Wouldn't you know -- he was the perfect magnet for my blades."
	"3974874096"	"Even gods can't stop me!"
	"1977782858"	"Why are the self-proclaimed deities always so easy to kill?"
	"48603868"	"I'm about to put a God on display! They might buy it..."
	"1804887826"	"Not everyone can be a star."
	"479418244"	"The moon waned rather quickly tonight."
	"2197275175"	"I'll be taking that magic cat, thank you!"
	"4126208689"	"Your death was written in the stars."
	"1828299531"	"I've never captured monkey royalty before!"
	"469668765"	"That's one less monkey cage that will need cleaning out."
	"2336329228"	"It IS my circus, but you're not my monkey."
	"819183710"	"I'm going to go chop down your favorite tree and turn it into a tent pole."
	"2691489231"	"You'll make great fertilizer. And still be doing your part."
	"3614174553"	"You like the forest? Well, now it's time for rest."
	"3081528508"	"I've spent years around carnies -- I'm immune to disease."
	"3232453674"	"Why are the undead always so grouchy?"
	"2965479589"	"A flea circus, well, that's something. But beetles? Who wants to see that?"
	"3351679027"	"When it comes to an audience, live bugs are a problem. But dead bugs of your unusual size? Well... That's an opportunity."
	"1590673801"	"Twice the heads, half the wits. Better luck next time, rubes."
	"701034783"	"You're both my target audience."
	"3111644302"	"I'm looking for freaks, not imbeciles."
	"3728349535"	"I'll always remember his laugh."
	"2839357897"	"You turn intelligence into power. I turn gullibility into profit. I simply have more to work with."
	"928627818"	"Even I think you're too into yourself, Pangolier."
	"1079938300"	"Want to impress me with that sword? Be useful and learn to swallow it."
	"3646414150"	"Don't worry, I'll put your blades to VERY good use."
	"2924539344"	"Some folk are just more cut out to be the target than the one with the blades."
	"1055912001"	"I find it's easier to be an assassin if you don't tell everyone you're an assassin."
	"1239990487"	"You're not going to get ME with stealth. I spent my life with pickpockets."
	"690964786"	"Clones?  Boring. Call me when you can turn yourself into conjoined twins."
	"1579710884"	"Not one happy clone in the bunch."
	"3340838942"	"Everywhere I go, all the suckers look the same."
	"670351616"	"You might be a butcher, but I'm the one who knows how to handle a beef."
	"1358164374"	"You don't impress me. I've seen what goes into hot dogs."
	"4205530146"	"Just a pickled punk that hadn't yet heard the news."
	"2376891572"	"You're also the Queen of FEELING Pain."
	"346369294"	"And we could've caused so much suffering together."
	"1671568792"	"Pain doesn't impress me. I've seen guys drive nails into their own heads for a buck."
	"4257646651"	"Lightning killed one of my best canvas men during setup. You had this coming."
	"331933975"	"What are you, a goat boy? I've seen better."
	"1691343233"	"You call that stealth? Try loading your wagons and skipping town in the middle of the night."
	"4101030928"	"I guess your magic act doesn't involve escaping."
	"2205676678"	"That's what you get for stealing people's gimmicks."
	"3819994467"	"You're not even mechanical! You're just glowy!"
	"3839736186"	"Good stage name, weak where it counts."
	"2480572908"	"I'm a huckster, a hustler and a born carnie. You came looking to steal a soul, you came to the wrong place."
	"181655638"	"Just another demonic bore."
	"2111105216"	"As snake charmers go, I've known more charming ones."
	"3983275345"	"Turning people into chickens is a start. Not biting their heads off is just poor showmanship. "
	"2590819783"	"The hushed murmur of the crowd? I revel in it. But silence? That won't do."
	"3365744288"	"If there's one thing I love, it's the sound of my own voice. And if there's one thing I hate, it's not being able to hear it!"
	"3214548534"	"Chop those things off and huck them in the fryer."
	"647188364"	"He soars through the air with the greatest of ease, that daring young man who now begs on his knees."
	"1368686362"	"You remind me of a monkey I once saw sewn to a fish. It was dead too."
	"3488672441"	"Smelled like a cop to me."
	"3103250991"	"You'll be part of my water spectacular!"
	"570330005"	"A little clown makeup and you'll be terrifying!"
	"1459206915"	"Nothing personal. Some of my best friends are ex-cons."
	"3326518930"	"Finally, some family friendly violence!"
	"2973865476"	"Fire breathing, fire eating, fart lighting, whatever. I've seen it."
	"3515228129"	"I'm only here for Mortimer."
	"2793484151"	"I'm not done with you, sniper. Not by a long shot."
	"1065909965"	"Your aim is fine. But this game is impossible to win."
	"1217351259"	"Stick to popping balloons and failing to knock down milk bottles."
	"3605781496"	"Haunting? Go behind the curtain, and I'll show you things that are really haunting."
	"2716658542"	"No, no, no, I said I wanted spectators!"
	"954579668"	"Sometimes I think animal acts are more trouble than they're worth."
	"1340246594"	"From bucking bull to rodeo clown."
	"3747452883"	"Jolly, energetic... You have the makings of a good clown and a bad fighter."
	"2824513349"	"This death must come as a shock to you."
	"2663876902"	"I had an elephant that got electrocuted once. Consider this payback."
	"130996380"	"I'll give it to you: That was an entertaining human cannonball act. I liked the part when you went boom and died."
	"2578074943"	"You're either dying or you're working for me now!"
	"4004347305"	"I like to kill the cast and the crew."
	"2007247891"	"I stopped worrying about bombing years ago."
	"2159115390"	"That's what you get, you geologic grump."
	"4155919592"	"Look, you're big, you're grey, you're dextrous with a trunk. But I already have an elephant."
	"1858018642"	"You'll be my biggest attraction. By volume."
	"905493022"	"You might attract mindless hordes, but I get them to buy tickets!"
	"2879139773"	"Don't resurrect on my behalf."
	"3701153579"	"You're either my new attraction or my new rug."
	"1167216273"	"It wouldn't be a carnival if we didn't offer bear claws."
	"848657927"	"You'd have been better off learning to ride a little bicycle."
	"2720686998"	"Can't fly without wings? Cry me a river. Ever heard of a trapeze?"
	"3576517376"	"Now you'll probably want revenge against me."
	"3052067557"	"You'll do great in my Vengeful Haunted House."
	"3270371955"	"I can take the poison, but I can't abide the spitting."
	"1541716937"	"Ooh, a scary snake. It's not every day you face an opponent who can be beaten with a FLUTE."
	"753109855"	"Do you really need all your poison glands?"
	"2995199740"	"Venom, toxin, whatever. What you are is box office poison."
	"3140571863"	"Talk about the animal handling act from hell."
	"3426116161"	"Your little demons work for me now."

	"2992678609"	"If you want spirit energy, try the high-spirited energy of live performance! Oh right, you're dead."
	"738472818"	"People will pay a fortune to see a dead god."
	"1526924260"	"So much thunder and lightning, and yet no creative spark."
